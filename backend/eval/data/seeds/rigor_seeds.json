She thought this sounded altogether too vague for a piece of technical writing: Is the computation needed or not? What is this \u201creally needed\u201d?",
    "reference_answer": "Clarify the evaluation of variable importance: (1) Remove vague language by specifying the criteria or metrics used for 'importance', (2) Detail how recursive feature elimination quantitatively assesses importance (e.g., by ranking features based on their contribution to prediction accuracy), and (3) Provide concrete results of the feature importance analysis (e.g., list top features and their scores). Example: 'Variable importance was assessed using recursive feature elimination, ranking features based on their impact on model accuracy. The top 3 features were X1 (score: 0.95), X2 (score: 0.92), and X3 (score: 0.89).'",

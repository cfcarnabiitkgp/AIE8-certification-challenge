course, one should make an eﬀort and try to avoid some easy pitfalls, that’s not exactly
what I am talking about. The rest of the paper is really a long answer to this question. But let us ﬁrst take a step back and answer more basic questions. 1.2. Being clear – how hard can that be? Well, it can be easy. But it can also be
pretty hard, especially if you are an inexperienced writer. The trouble with being clear
as a concept, is that most people think it doesn’t take time. They think one naturally
becomes a better writer. Quite the opposite is true. Making your paper clearer takes
time and a lot of eﬀort. You learn to do this faster of course, but it’s still a slow process. I once asked Noga Alon how did he get to be so good (and so fast!) at writing. He said
“it gets easier after the ﬁrst 300 papers”. Now, as it always happens, the real test of your commitment to clarity is not when
it’s easy, but when it’s hard. Imagine the following scenario. While ﬁnishing your paper
you realized that in some sections you use h as a variable, and in other sections h is a
function. And on the very last page you had to write h(h) which is just awful. What
should you do? Should you spend maybe 30 min going over every instance of h in the
paper and renaming it accordingly? Can’t you just make a disclaimer at the beginning
⋆Department of Mathematics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095. Email: pak(@math).ucla.edu. 1Mathematically, this statement is completely false. But that’s part of my point – how would anyone
even know that in the second version? When you are unclear, all claims look reasonably true. 1","The vague language in the sentence 'However, its applicability remains unclear due to certain constraints that need to be addressed' is problematic.

"The novel algorithm addresses the classical vehicle routing issue, purportedly delivering solutions that surpass the efficiency of traditional heuristics. Nonetheless, certain limitations remain inadequately explained, potentially affecting its real-world deployment.","In his famous and otherwise very useful talk, J.-P. Serre
advises against writing Q ⊂R since one is the set of pairs of integers, another is set
of Cauchy sequences, and there is more than one possible embedding (I am paraphras-
ing).10 Right. Whatever, I disagree. I feel that when it comes to standard or easy
notions, the extra explanations are distracting and make the paper less clear. So unless
you are a member of Bourbaki just ignore this advice by Serre. To give another example, if you talking about domino tilings of a region, there no need
to discuss how the region should be covered without the overlap except at boundaries
of dominoes, what does it mean for a region to be simply connected, etc. Just draw a

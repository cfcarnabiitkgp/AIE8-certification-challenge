      "justification": "The example is realistic as it reflects common practices in academic papers regarding hyperparameter tuning, though it could be slightly more detailed to achieve a perfect score. The clarity of the issue is excellent, as the example clearly distinguishes between less and more informative descriptions of hyperparameter tuning. The pedagogical value is high because it highlights the importance of detailed reporting in research, which is a subtle but crucial aspect of scientific communication. The actionability is perfect, as the example provides specific before-and-after scenarios that are immediately applicable. The guideline alignment is also perfect, as the example directly addresses the need for clarity and detail in reporting hyperparameter tuning strategies. Overall, the example is of high quality and should be included in the dataset."

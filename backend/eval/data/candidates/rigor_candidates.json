    "reference_question": "The optimization algorithm was tested on 25 diverse, randomly selected urban transportation networks from the well-known OpenStreetMap dataset. The analysis indicated that our algorithm consistently reduced the total travel time by an average of 18% compared to the initial heuristic routing strategy. These results underscore the potential of our method in enhancing the efficiency of large-scale urban transportation systems.",
    "reference_context": "Clarify the evaluation process to ensure the proof's intent remains intact but more concise. Additionally, provide a thorough comparison using a baseline and meticulous documentation of hyperparameters. Consider the following: (1) Compare performance against a widely-used optimization algorithm, such as A* search, to set a benchmark, (2) Explicitly describe the hyperparameters used, including learning rate, iteration count, and convergence criteria, (3) Incorporate statistical measures like standard deviation or confidence intervals to indicate the reliability of the results. For example: 'Our approach achieved an 18% reduction in travel time (average \u00b1 standard deviation of 18% \u00b1 3% across 25 networks), surpassing the A* search baseline (14% \u00b1 2%, p < 0.01, paired t-test). Hyperparameters included a learning rate of 0.005, 1500 iterations, and a convergence threshold of 0.001.'",
    "reference_answer": "To enhance the transparency of our findings, we incorporated a baseline comparison and provided detailed reporting of the hyperparameters involved. By benchmarking against the established A* search algorithm on the OpenStreetMap dataset, we secured a performance baseline: 'Our algorithm resulted in an 18% reduction in travel time (18% \u00b1 3% mean \u00b1 standard deviation over 25 networks), outperforming the A* search benchmark (14% \u00b1 2%, p < 0.01, according to a paired t-test). The hyperparameters were meticulously recorded: learning rate set at 0.005, iteration count at 1500, with a convergence criterion of 0.001.'

Algorithms for\nparsing English sentences are there illustrated as charts de\ufb01ning augmented transition net-\nworks or ATN\u2019s\u2014nodes correspond to internal states, edges are transitions between states\nand correspond to individual words. Winograd also has a nice use of nested diagrams\u2014\nboxes within boxes\u2014to replace the more traditional tree diagrams. We saw a scattergram of smiley-faces of somewhat indeterminate signi\ufb01cance; a wit in\nSITN projected Don\u2019s amongst them. The idea is that several dimensions of numeric\ndata can be used to control features on these faces; humans are supposedly wired to read\nnuances in facial expressions quite easily. Don showed us a table from his Art of Computer Programming that listed the many,\nmany states of the Caltech elevator. He said he wished that he\u2019d been able to dream up a\ndiagram to capture that example more neatly: A listing of events is the best way he knows\nto convey the essential features of asynchronous processes. The third Volume of this tome does contain a large fold-out illustration comparing the\nperformances of various sort-on-tapes algorithms. Certain subtleties arise from overlaps,\nrewinds, and bu\ufb00ering that tend to elude conventional algorithmic analysis. Don\u2019s diagram\nneatly captures these, and clearly shows that certain sophisticated algorithms\u2014one was\neven patented by its author\u2014are in fact slower than traditional methods. Unanticipated\nrewind times can cause signi\ufb01cant slow-downs, and the chart shows why. [\u00a7\uf731\uf738. ILLUSTRATIONS (1)\n39]",

        "He could\nhave used a speci\ufb01c programming language, but he was afraid that such a choice would\nalienate people (either because they hated the language or because they had no access to\nthe language). So he decided to write his algorithms in English. His Algorithms are presented rather like Theorems with labeled steps; often they have\naccompanying (but very high-level) \ufb02ow charts (a technique he \ufb01rst saw in Russian liter-\nature of the 1950s). The numbered steps have parenthetical remarks that we would call\ncomments; after 1968 these parenthetical remarks are often invariant relations that can be\nused in a formal proof of program correctness. Don has received many letters complimenting him on his approach, but he says it is not\nreally successful. Explaining why, he said, \u201cPeople keep saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to present an\nalgorithm in Knuth\u2019s style,\u2019 and then they completely botch it by ignoring the conventions\nI think are most important. This style must just be a personal style that works for me. So get a personal style that works for you.\u201d In recent papers he has used the pidgin Algol\nstyle introduced by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman; but he will not change his style for the\nyet-un\ufb01nished volumes of The Art of Computer Programming because he wants to keep\nthe entire series consistent. Don says that a computer program is a piece of literature. (\u201cI look forward to the day\nwhen a Pulitzer Prize will be given for the best computer program of the year.\u201d)\nHe\nsays that, apart from the bene\ufb01t to be gained for the readers of our programs, he \ufb01nds\nthat treating programs in this manner actually helps to make them run smoothly on the\ncomputer. (\u201cBecause you get it right when you have to think about it that way.\u201d)\nHe gave us a reprint of \u201cProgramming Pearls\u201d by Jon Bentley, from Communications of\nthe ACM 29 (May 1986), pages 364\u2013369, and told us we had best read it by Wednesday\nsince it will be an important topic of discussion.

However, the problem solved\nby an algorithm can have di\ufb00erent known complexities at di\ufb00erent times; therefore \u2018had\u2019\nwould be okay if \u2018algorithms\u2019 were \u2018problems\u2019.

        "\u00a7\uf731\uf739. Excerpts from class, November 6\n[notes by TLL]\nWe spent the \ufb01rst half of class examining the solutions to a homework assignment (see \u00a7\uf732\uf730\nbelow). Don says that the solutions were surprisingly good (see \u00a7\uf732\uf731). One of the proofs described in that section contains illustrations in four colors. Don says\nthat color can be used e\ufb00ectively in talks, but usually not in papers (for that matter,\nLeslie Lamport says that proofs should never be presented in talks, but only in papers). Technical illustrations, even without four colors, cause no end of trouble: Don says that\nthe amount of work involved in preparing a paper for publication is proportional to the\ncube of the number of illustrations. But they are indispensable in many cases. Don showed us several of the illustrations, charts, and tables from The Art of Computer\nProgramming, Volume 3, and recounted the di\ufb03culties in choosing clear methods of pre-\nsenting his ideas. He also mentioned some technical and artistic problems that he had with\nan illustration: At what angle should the truncated octahedron on page 13 be displayed? His books contain some numerical tables (\u201cwhich are sometimes thought to be unenlight-\nening\u201d); Don says that they can sometimes present ideas that can\u2019t be demonstrated\ngraphically (such as numbers oscillating about 2 with period 2\u03c0, page 41). Diagrams with\naccompanying text are also used. Don made sure that the \ufb01nal text was arranged opposite\nthe diagrams to which it refers. The book contains a running example of how 16 particular numbers are sorted by dozens\nof di\ufb00erent algorithms. Each algorithm leads to a di\ufb00erent graphical presentation of the\nsorting activities on those numbers (pages 77, 82, 84, 97, 98, 106, 110, 113, 115, 124, 140,\n143, 147, 151, 161, 165, 166, 172, 175, 205, 251, 253, 254, 359). \u00a7\uf732\uf730.

        ". holds, the coe\ufb03cients are all zero. Hence\nthe variables are linearly independent.\u201d\nDon pointed out that proof by contradiction is often the easiest way to prove something\nwhen you\u2019re \ufb01rst solving a problem for yourself, but such stream-of-consciousness proofs\ndon\u2019t usually lead to the best exposition. Paul wound up his speech by repeating his opening rules: \u201cDo organize,\u201d and \u201cDo not\ndistract.\u201d\nThe trouble is that it is hard to say what organization is."

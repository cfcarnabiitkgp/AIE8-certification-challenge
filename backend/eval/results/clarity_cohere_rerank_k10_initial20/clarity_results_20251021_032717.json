Send it to somebody on your national math olympiad\ncommittee (which comprise IMO), or the Putnam committee. They are always looking\nfor good and unusual problems, and many problems are in fact created this way. Third, if the problem you extract is too di\ufb03cult for the Putnam Competition, but\nyour argument in this case substantially simpli\ufb01es, write it up in a separate note. Try\nto make it accessible to undergraduates. Submit it to Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Intelligencer, Math. Magazine, or another journal targeting students and teachers.

Rota advises to publish the same paper several times, and gives some famous exam-\nples [13]. While I disagree with this practice, I think there is a room for compromise.

First and foremost, do NOT use BibTeX, unless you are\nan advanced user and know exactly what you are doing. Even if you have hundreds\nof references, or especially if you do. MathSciNet citations tend to be bloated with\nunnecessary details and have inconsistent style and author\u2019s spelling.

If you can extract a little result which can be stated in the language that high\nschool or college students can understand and possibly solve by a direct argument, make\nit into an olympiad style problem. Send it to somebody on your national math olympiad\ncommittee (which comprise IMO), or the Putnam committee. They are always looking\nfor good and unusual problems, and many problems are in fact created this way. Third, if the problem you extract is too di\ufb03cult for the Putnam Competition, but\nyour argument in this case substantially simpli\ufb01es, write it up in a separate note. Try\nto make it accessible to undergraduates. Submit it to Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Intelligencer, Math. Magazine, or another journal targeting students and teachers.

Say, for example, in your latest paper the argument is cumbersome because you are\novergeneralizing. It is then ok to start with a proof of a known theorem \u201cfor com-\npleteness\u201d and then explain how this proof needs to be modi\ufb01ed to work in greater\ngenerality.

This helps neither the\nreaders to \ufb01nd anything at all, nor the authors of 2\u201319 to get credit; in fact, it pits them\nagainst each other by unfairly equalizing their research contributions. What you should\ndo is go over the papers individually, starting with the most important reference, and\ndescribe their contribution. Stop when you are tired. Here is an example of how this\nworks:\nOur Theorem 3 studies partitions into even primes. A strongly related re-\nsult in [A] studies partitions into into primes which are powers of two. This\npaper builds on the tools in [B], which studies partitions into primes which are\nsquares. In a di\ufb00erent direction, partitions into even Fermat primes have been\nstudied in [C,D], and more recently in [E], which under the GRH established\nWigner\u2019s semicircle law in this case. In an unusual development, last year [F]\nproved uncomputability of the partition function into odd perfect numbers,\nbut the paper remains under scrutiny (my colleague Kiran X. has been un-\nsuccessful in independently verifying the result). We should also mention a\nseries of papers [G1,G2,G3] on partitions into prime Catalan numbers, which\nsuccessively improves on the classical bound in [H] by using...

A side bene\ufb01t of this is a dynamic semi-survey feature your paper achieves. Since the\narXiv is easily updateable, you can continue adding new subsections to Final Remarks\nwithout changing anything else in the paper. This allows you to stake or communicate\nyour new ideas even before you get an opportunity to write a new paper. For exam-\nple, adding an outline of a solution of a (non-major) conjecture can help you fend o\ufb00\ncompetition, a \ufb02exible version of \u201cadded in print\u201d feature the traditional journals have. 3.8."

        "Introduction. This is the hardest section to write. It\u2019s probably the only part of\nyour paper that will be read by all but a few most devoted readers. If you have a senior\ncoauthor, ask her or him to write this. If you don\u2019t, ask a senior colleague to read it\nand comment on your draft. Start writing your paper by writing the \ufb01rst draft of the\nIntroduction, so you have an idea what\u2019s in the paper, and completely rewrite it after\nthe rest of the paper is written. More often than not, the paper turns up di\ufb00erently\nthan you initially imagined it. This could be for technical reasons, or since you proved\nmore results, or now understand your own results much better than when you started\nwriting. Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the\nhistory of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly out-\nlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way\ntowards getting us a couple of readers.\u201d\nAs I explained earlier, the problem with this approach is that \u201cnowadays\u201d some people\ndon\u2019t even have patience to read a long introduction. So what should you do? Well,\nmake a lengthy introduction, Rota\u2013style, extract a few pages to keep in the introduction\nand the rest put into Final Remarks. Alternatively, use a Foreword. More on these\nlater. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these",
        "Some trickery is useful sometimes. Say, you introduce some cumbersome class of\npermutations and give their asymptotic analysis. Give them a name! Say, these per-\nmutations are inspired by Alice Munro\u2019s book. Call them Munro permutations right in\nthe beginning of the paper and make the title \u201cAsymptotic analysis of Munro\u2019s permu-\ntations\u201d. The reader may or may not \ufb01nd this title appealing enough to click on the\narticle, but at least it conveys some sense of what\u2019s in the paper.",
        "Advertise and popularize. There are several ways you can make the paper\nmore accessible to larger audiences. This may depend on your area, but let me suggest\njust a few. If you ever give a recorded talk on the paper, make a link on your website\nto the talk right next to the paper. Keep the .pdf \ufb01le with slides alongside.19 Try\nto explain the gist on your blog, even if it\u2019s mostly dormant and has no subscribers. Again, link the blog entry to your website alongside the paper. There are a few more things you can do, all of them harder. First, write a survey\non the subject. If you want to do a good job, this takes a lot of hard work. But you\ncan learn a great deal and are able to place your results into context where they would\nbe better understood. According to Rota, \u201cYou are more likely to be remembered by\nyour expository work\u201d [13]. While I don\u2019t fully agree, there is a lot of truth to this. 19See my blog post what to do about giving talks and what to do with the videos: https://igorpak. wordpress.com/2015/05/02/you-should-watch-combinatorics-videos/",
        "HOW TO WRITE A CLEAR MATH PAPER\n7\nWhat not to include: Technical de\ufb01nitions, examples, big \ufb01gures illustrating some spe-\ncial cases, etc. Instead, whenever relevant and you feel like including them, use \u201c(see\nFigure 5.1)\u201d or \u201c(see the exact de\ufb01nition in \u00a73.4)\u201d to get your point across. The in-\nterested reader will click on the link to take a look and use the Back button in the\nReader to get back to the Introduction. Also, ignore Rota\u2019s \u201cgiving everybody his due\u201d advice \u2013 it\u2019s no longer applicable as\nstated. Most likely, there are too many relevant papers, so it\u2019s impossible to do this\nin the introduction and control its length. Instead, explain the history that\u2019s directly\nrelevant to your main result. For example, \u201cPaper [A] asked about XYZ and proved\nweak-XYZ. Last year, paper [B] showed that strong-XYZ is false. In this paper we\nre\ufb01ne the tools in [B] to show that XYZ is also false. We conjecture that the weak-\nXYZ is the strongest possible result in this direction. We also analyze the examples in\n[C] and show that...\u201d You get the idea. In the last paragraph or subsection of the Introduction, outline the structure of the\npaper in your own words. In the absence of the table of content, this helps the reader\nto navigate the paper and use section links visible in the Adobe Reader. 3.6.",

        "While, of\ncourse, one should make an e\ufb00ort and try to avoid some easy pitfalls, that\u2019s not exactly\nwhat I am talking about. The rest of the paper is really a long answer to this question. But let us \ufb01rst take a step back and answer more basic questions. 1.2. Being clear \u2013 how hard can that be? Well, it can be easy. But it can also be\npretty hard, especially if you are an inexperienced writer. The trouble with being clear\nas a concept, is that most people think it doesn\u2019t take time. They think one naturally\nbecomes a better writer. Quite the opposite is true. Making your paper clearer takes\ntime and a lot of e\ufb00ort. You learn to do this faster of course, but it\u2019s still a slow process. I once asked Noga Alon how did he get to be so good (and so fast!) at writing. He said\n\u201cit gets easier after the \ufb01rst 300 papers\u201d. Now, as it always happens, the real test of your commitment to clarity is not when\nit\u2019s easy, but when it\u2019s hard. Imagine the following scenario. While \ufb01nishing your paper\nyou realized that in some sections you use h as a variable, and in other sections h is a\nfunction. And on the very last page you had to write h(h) which is just awful. What\nshould you do? Should you spend maybe 30 min going over every instance of h in the\npaper and renaming it accordingly? Can\u2019t you just make a disclaimer at the beginning\n\u22c6Department of Mathematics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095. Email: pak(@math).ucla.edu. 1Mathematically, this statement is completely false. But that\u2019s part of my point \u2013 how would anyone\neven know that in the second version? When you are unclear, all claims look reasonably true. 1",
        "not competing on the same level (yet). In fact, there is an actual checklist on what it\ntakes for senior people to read your paper [1]. Study the checklist and make sure you\nget an easy pass. Finally, for all mathematicians: clear writing will give you a competitive advantage. It is often the case that the same or nearly the same result is obtained in several papers. If your paper is clear and your competitors\u2019 are not, you will get the credit. I know,\nthis is unfair. Think about it di\ufb00erently \u2013 you outworked your competition and created\na better product. Sometimes it\u2019s not about the substance but the presentation.2 As\neveryone knows, recording of the same symphony by di\ufb00erent orchestra can have very\ndi\ufb00erent values. In the era of winner-take-all society it shouldn\u2019t be surprising that the\nsame happens to math papers. 1.4.",

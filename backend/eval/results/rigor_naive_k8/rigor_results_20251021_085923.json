He showed us a bibliography he\u2019s preparing\nthat references not only that paper but another with even more symbols in the title. (Such titles make more than bibliographies di\ufb03cult; they make bibliographic data retrieval\nsystems and keyword-in-context produce all sorts of hiccups.)\nIn his bibliography Knuth has tried to keep his citations true to the original sources. The bibliography contains mathematical formulas, full name spellings (even alternative\nspellings when common), and completely spelled-out source journal names. (This last\nmay be unusual enough that some members of a \ufb01eld may be surprised to see the full\njournal name written out, but it\u2019s a big help to novices who want to \ufb01nd it in the library.)\nWe spent the rest of class going over some of the solutions that students had turned in for\nthe exercise of \u00a7\uf732(each sample anonymous). He cautioned us that while he was generally\npleased by the assignments, he was going to be pointing out things that could be improved. The following points were all made in the process of going through these samples. In certain instances, people did not understand what constitutes a proof. Fluency\nin mathematics is important for Computer Science students but will not be taught\nin this class. Not all formulas are equations.

Computer Scientists must be careful to distinguish between mathematical notation\nand programming language notation. While it may be appropriate to use p[r] in a\nprogram, in a formal paper it is probably better to use p with a subscript of r.

        "actually quite easy to do in WEB, a claim that was greeted with a certain skeptical laughter\nfrom the class (all doubtless recalling hours spent wasted trying to get tables just right). Referring again to his \u2018optimal prepaging\u2019 paper (which included a diagram in which two\napproximately diagonal lines crawled across the page, touching occasionally to indicate a\npage fault) Don told us that the referee had complained that the \ufb01gure was too detailed. Don disagreed with this, saying that the detail was there for those who want to see it, but\ncould easily be ignored by those who don\u2019t. Don confessed that he always has been very\nconcerned with the minuti\u00e6 of his subject, and seldom thought any detail too tri\ufb02ing to\nbother with. Don discussed a paper he had written with Michael Plass on TEX\u2019s algorithm for placing\nline-breaks in a paragraph [Software\u2014Practice & Experience 11 (1981), 1119\u20131184]. The\nmain di\ufb03culty in writing the paper was: How to describe the problem and the new al-\ngorithm? First of all, they chose a paragraph from one of Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales as \u201ctest\ndata\u201d with which to illustrate the process. As Don remarked once before, it is better to\nuse \u201creal\u201d data than \u201csample data\u201d that have in fact been cooked up solely to use as an\nexample. [Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales, along with the text of Harold and Maude, are kept online\non SAIL, an ancient and eccentric CSD computer.] Corresponding to each line of any right-\nand-left-justi\ufb01ed paragraph is a real number, positive or negative, indicating the degree to\nwhich the line had to be stretched or compressed to \ufb01t the space exactly. In his paper,\nDon prints these numbers in a column beside his typeset paragraph. Don used a couple of\nlines of the paper itself to show how bad it looks if these adjustments are too extreme (and\nof course had to tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they \u201ccorrect\u201d it). Don outlined three basic algorithms: \ufb01rst \ufb01t (which essentially packs the text as tightly as",

Algorithms for\nparsing English sentences are there illustrated as charts de\ufb01ning augmented transition net-\nworks or ATN\u2019s\u2014nodes correspond to internal states, edges are transitions between states\nand correspond to individual words. Winograd also has a nice use of nested diagrams\u2014\nboxes within boxes\u2014to replace the more traditional tree diagrams. We saw a scattergram of smiley-faces of somewhat indeterminate signi\ufb01cance; a wit in\nSITN projected Don\u2019s amongst them. The idea is that several dimensions of numeric\ndata can be used to control features on these faces; humans are supposedly wired to read\nnuances in facial expressions quite easily. Don showed us a table from his Art of Computer Programming that listed the many,\nmany states of the Caltech elevator. He said he wished that he\u2019d been able to dream up a\ndiagram to capture that example more neatly: A listing of events is the best way he knows\nto convey the essential features of asynchronous processes. The third Volume of this tome does contain a large fold-out illustration comparing the\nperformances of various sort-on-tapes algorithms. Certain subtleties arise from overlaps,\nrewinds, and bu\ufb00ering that tend to elude conventional algorithmic analysis. Don\u2019s diagram\nneatly captures these, and clearly shows that certain sophisticated algorithms\u2014one was\neven patented by its author\u2014are in fact slower than traditional methods.

        "of course had to tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they \u201ccorrect\u201d it). Don outlined three basic algorithms: \ufb01rst \ufb01t (which essentially packs the text as tightly as\npossible one line at a time); best \ufb01t (which can loosen it up if this works better, but still\nworks line by line); and optimum \ufb01t (optimal in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the\n\u201cdemerits\u201d earned by the various distortions of each line, taken over the paragraph as a\nwhole). To describe this last algorithm, Don drew a diagram. It is essentially a graph, each\nnode on level p corresponding to a di\ufb00erent word after which the pth line might be broken. Edges run between nodes on successive levels, and are labeled by the demerits scored by\nthe line of text they de\ufb01ne. The problem of \ufb01nding an optimal \ufb01t thus reduces to \ufb01nding\na least-cost path from the top to the bottom node; well-understood search techniques can\nbe used for this. Don commented that certain \u201cdemerit-cuto\ufb00s\u201d will limit the number of\nnodes on each level and thus speed the algorithm. This means that a solution in which\none very distorted line permits all the rest to be displayed perfectly might be missed. If the above account is opaque, it only goes to show why diagrams can be so useful. The article includes histograms to illustrate how frequently TEX generates more-or-less\ndistorted lines of text. As he explained, this was biased by the fact that he would usually\nre-write any particularly ugly paragraph. A second histogram con\ufb01rmed that the text was\nconsiderably more distorted when it hadn\u2019t been hand-crafted to the line width that TEX\nwas generating, yet the new algorithm was signi\ufb01cantly better than Brands X and Y . Finally, we saw an old Bible whose printers were so keen to \ufb01ll out the page width that\nthey inserted strings of o\u2019s to \ufb01ll up any gaps."

        "To illustrate the programs, Don had run them on a dozen or so sample texts. For instance,\nhe used a passage from the rather ponderous introduction to a book by Alonzo Church;\nsamples of PMR\u2019s and TLL\u2019s notes for CS 209; versions of his own exposition of binomial\ncoe\ufb03cients, vintage 1965 and 1985; Wuthering Heights; Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales; and part\nof a book about the Bible that Don is writing on weekends. The style routine produces\nfour di\ufb00erent readability grades for any piece of text. Each is literally a \u201cgrade\u201d in that\nit indicates what level of education the piece suggests. The basis of the grading is very\nstraightforward; it\u2019s a linear formula whose variables are the average number of syllables\n(or letters) per word and the average number of words per sentence (or sometimes the\nreciprocal of this value). For example, there are constants \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 such that\ngrade = \u03b1 (words/sentence) + \u03b2 (syllables/word) + \u03b3. How were \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 determined? The authors of each readability index simply look at\na large number of pieces of writing and assign them a grade-level \u2018by eye\u2019\u2014that is, they\nestimate the age of the intended reader. Each piece of text is then characterised by three\nreal numbers: the average number of words per sentence, the average number of syllables\nper word, and the subjective grade level. So each piece determines a single point in 3-space\n(plotted against three orthogonal axes); the set of pieces determines a scatter of points in\n3-space. Standard linear regression techniques are used to \ufb01nd the plane that is the \u201cbest\n\ufb01t\u201d for these points. The three parameters above de\ufb01ne this plane. Someone asked whether we should be shooting for some speci\ufb01c grade level, and if so, what\nlevel? Don replied that his usual aim is to minimise the level, although overdoing this will\ndefeat the purpose. In addition to the raw scores, a variety of other parameters come out of a style analysis:",

        "of course had to tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they \u201ccorrect\u201d it). Don outlined three basic algorithms: \ufb01rst \ufb01t (which essentially packs the text as tightly as\npossible one line at a time); best \ufb01t (which can loosen it up if this works better, but still\nworks line by line); and optimum \ufb01t (optimal in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the\n\u201cdemerits\u201d earned by the various distortions of each line, taken over the paragraph as a\nwhole). To describe this last algorithm, Don drew a diagram. It is essentially a graph, each\nnode on level p corresponding to a di\ufb00erent word after which the pth line might be broken. Edges run between nodes on successive levels, and are labeled by the demerits scored by\nthe line of text they de\ufb01ne. The problem of \ufb01nding an optimal \ufb01t thus reduces to \ufb01nding\na least-cost path from the top to the bottom node; well-understood search techniques can\nbe used for this. Don commented that certain \u201cdemerit-cuto\ufb00s\u201d will limit the number of\nnodes on each level and thus speed the algorithm. This means that a solution in which\none very distorted line permits all the rest to be displayed perfectly might be missed.

As he explained, this was biased by the fact that he would usually\nre-write any particularly ugly paragraph. A second histogram con\ufb01rmed that the text was\nconsiderably more distorted when it hadn\u2019t been hand-crafted to the line width that TEX\nwas generating, yet the new algorithm was signi\ufb01cantly better than Brands X and Y . Finally, we saw an old Bible whose printers were so keen to \ufb01ll out the page width that\nthey inserted strings of o\u2019s to \ufb01ll up any gaps.",
        "One of her tricks was to study the \ufb01rst 10 complete sentences on the third page of every\npaper. First she charted the average length of the 10 sentences: They varied from 15.6\nwords per sentence to 24.4 words per sentence. Mary-Claire says that any of us with\naverages under 20 words per sentence are in the correct range for adult writing. (But the\nwriter with the 24.4 average had better have results pretty wonderful, to compensate for\nthe extra work that it takes to read his paper.)\nSheer variation in sentence length is one indication of syntactic variation and appropriate\npacing. With 10 sentences we should be aiming for 9 or 10 di\ufb00erent lengths. The samples\nfrom our papers yielded 6 to 9 di\ufb00erent lengths. The di\ufb00erence between the word count\non the shortest sentence to the word count on the longest varied between 17 words to 37\nwords. The ideal chart of sentence lengths should look like a bell-curve centered around\n15 to 18 words per sentence. She asks us to note that we did not have enough short (\u201cand punchy\u201d) sentences. A few\nlong sentences are also important. She said, \u201cA well constructed 46-word sentence is not\na di\ufb03cult beast, but it had better not be your crucial point.\u201d We should remember that\nwe have a responsibility to emphasize and deemphasize our points to the reader; long\nsentences are one method of deemphasizing a point. Beyond the word counts, she looked at the templates used to construct our sentences. For example, she found two writers who would appear to be similar if we just looked\nat their sentence length average and variation, but who had quite di\ufb00erent methods of\nconstructing their sentences. One of these writers used the same sentence construction\nfor almost every sentence (adverbial + subject + transitive-verb + object), and the other\nused many di\ufb00erent styles of construction.

        "\u00a7\uf733. An Answer\nHere is one way to complete the exercise in the previous section. (But please try to work\nit yourself before reading this.) Note that a few clauses have been inserted to help\nkeep the reader synchronized with the current goals and subgoals and strategies of the\nproof. Furthermore the notation (b1, . . . , bn) is used instead of (p1, . . . , pn), in the second\nparagraph below, to avoid confusion with formula (2). Proof. Assume that L(C, P) \u2286An. Since C is always contained in L(C, P), we must\nhave C \u2286An; therefore only the condition P \u2286An needs to be veri\ufb01ed. If P is not contained in An, there must be a vector (b1, . . . , bn) \u2208P such that bi < bj\nfor some i < j. We want to show that this leads to a contradiction. Since the set C is nonempty, it contains some element (c1, . .",
        ". , cn). Now the vector (c1, . . . , cn) + k(b1, . . . , bn) is an element of L(C, P) for all k \u22650, and by\nhypothesis it must therefore be an element of An. But this means that ci + kbi \u2265cj + kbj,\ni.e.,\nci \u2212cj \u2265k(bj \u2212bi),\n(3)\nfor arbitrarily large k. Consequently bj \u2212bi must be zero or negative. We have proved that bj \u2212bi \u22640 for all i < j, so the vector (b1, . . . , bn) must be an\nelement of An. This form of the proof has other virtues too: It doesn\u2019t assume that the bi\u2019s are\ninteger-valued, and it doesn\u2019t require stating that c1 \u2265\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u2265cn.

Now (c1, . . . , cn)+k(b1, . . . , bn) is an element of L(C, P) for all k \u22650, and by hypoth-\nesis it must therefore be an element of An. But if we take k = ci \u2212cj + 1, we have k \u22651\nand\nci + kbi \u2265cj + kbj,\nhence\nci \u2212cj \u2265k(bj \u2212bi). (3)\nThis is impossible, since ci \u2212cj = k \u22121 is less than k, yet bj \u2212bi \u22651. It follows that\n(b1, . . . , bn) must be an element of An. Note that the hypothesis C \u0338= \u2205is necessary in Lemma 1, for if C is empty the set\nL(C, P) is also empty regardless of P. [This was the \u201cminor slip.\u201d]\nBUT .",
        "}. This solution also simpli\ufb01es Sierpi\u00b4nski\u2019s\nproof in minor ways. For example, it\u2019s not necessary to have the hypothesis \u03b1 \u0338= \u03b2 to\nconclude that \u03b1 \u2208A\u03b2 or \u03b2 \u2208A\u03b1, because the existence of a family A\u03b1 that satis\ufb01es\nSierpi\u00b4nski\u2019s more complicated hypothesis is equivalent to the existence of a family that\nsatis\ufb01es the simpli\ufb01ed one. The grader objected to the last sentence in the \ufb01rst paragraph of my proof. He asks, \u201cHas\nsome \u2018initialization\u2019 of L\u03b1 been omitted?\u201d He apparently wants k = 1 to be singled out as\na special case, for more e\ufb00ective exposition. The sentence makes perfectly good sense to\nme, but maybe there should be a concession to readers who are unaccustomed to empty\nconstraints. Solution B introduces two nice techniques of a di\ufb00erent kind. First, the lemma becomes\na sequence of ordered pairs instead of an ordered pair of sequences. Second, the need for\na notational correspondence between \u03b1 and the corresponding sequence is avoided by just\nusing English words, saying that one is the counterpart of the other. In other words, we\ncan hold back in giving notations for a correspondence, since plain words are su\ufb03cient\n(even better at times). Solution B also \u201cfactors\u201d the proof into two parts, one that describes a subgoal (the crucial\nproperty that the functions fn will possess) and one that applies the coup de grace. Much\nless must be kept in mind when you read a factored proof, because the two pieces have a\nsimple interface. Moreover, the reader is told that the proof is \u201cessentially a diagonalization\ntechnique\u201d; this statement gives an extremely helpful orientation. It is no wonder that the\ngrader found Solution B easier to understand than Solution A. Solution C is by another student who found words superior to notation in this case. Solution D cannot be shown in full because it contains seven illustrations, some of which",

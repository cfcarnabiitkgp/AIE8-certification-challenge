        "Introduction. This is the hardest section to write. It\u2019s probably the only part of\nyour paper that will be read by all but a few most devoted readers. If you have a senior\ncoauthor, ask her or him to write this. If you don\u2019t, ask a senior colleague to read it\nand comment on your draft. Start writing your paper by writing the \ufb01rst draft of the\nIntroduction, so you have an idea what\u2019s in the paper, and completely rewrite it after\nthe rest of the paper is written. More often than not, the paper turns up di\ufb00erently\nthan you initially imagined it. This could be for technical reasons, or since you proved\nmore results, or now understand your own results much better than when you started\nwriting. Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the\nhistory of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly out-\nlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way\ntowards getting us a couple of readers.\u201d\nAs I explained earlier, the problem with this approach is that \u201cnowadays\u201d some people\ndon\u2019t even have patience to read a long introduction. So what should you do? Well,\nmake a lengthy introduction, Rota\u2013style, extract a few pages to keep in the introduction\nand the rest put into Final Remarks. Alternatively, use a Foreword. More on these\nlater. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these",
        "Can\u2019t journals help? In a word, NO. In my experience the copy editors can\npoint out some sentences which are unclear. But these are linguistics rather than math\nissues. It\u2019s like when you are editing a literary book in an unfamiliar foreign language. Sometimes you can still \ufb01nd some hanging sentences, sentences without a verb, etc.,\neven if you have no clue what is being said. 2I wrote in [11] how Sylvester\u2019s \u201c\ufb01sh-hook\u201d bijection was rediscovered in over a dozen papers. Most\nauthors were aware of other versions, yet all claimed their presentation to be superior over others.",
        "diverse readership styles. 3. Macro tips\n3.1. Structure of the paper. Every newspaper writing guide, including the above\nmentioned [18], will advise to write an article in a Matryoshka doll manner \u2013 start\nwith a super brief summary, then make a longer summary, and only then, once the\nreader is hooked and interested in details, proceed to give a complete set of facts. Over\nthe years, math articles developed a similar structure with a progression of the title,\nabstract, introduction, the main part, \ufb01nal remarks and references. I feel that modern\npractices make some corrections here when compared to old guidelines. Let me discuss\neach part separately.",
        "HOW TO WRITE A CLEAR MATH PAPER\n5\nactually like the name, you can denote this set An, and use the notation for the rest of\nthe paper. There are drawbacks in this approach. If others \ufb01nd the name useful they will always\nattribute the objects to Munro. For example, some years ago I introduced the iterated\nDyson\u2019s map, and people are using it now without ever mentioning me. I lost that\nbattle.",
        "Also, this approach might raise some eyebrows of the referees. At one point,\nmy coauthor and I invented Gayley polytopes named after a street I lived on, and to\nrhyme with Cayley polytopes of which they were Generalizations to all Graphs G (get\nit?) The referee was annoyed, but we kept the name just because it\u2019s amusing and\nmemorable. Finally, let me self-quote the title naming advice I gave on MathOverflow, with some\npossibly useful examples of titles:4\n\u201cYou should emphasize not the length but the content. If you prove that\nall tennis balls are white make the title \u201cAll tennis balls are white\u201d. If you\nprove that some tennis balls are white, title your note \u201cOn white tennis balls\u201d,\nor \u201cNew examples of white tennis balls\u201d, or whatever. If your note is a new\nsimple proof, and this is what you want to emphasize, make the title \u201cShort\nproof that all tennis balls are white\u201d. If there was a conjecture that all tennis\nballs were white and you found a counterexample, use \u201cNot all tennis balls are\nwhite\u201d. If you study further properties of white tennis balls, use \u201cA remark\non white tennis balls\u201d. You see the idea. \u201cOn the other hand, if you wrote a survey, it\u2019s important to emphasize that,\nregardless whether it\u2019s long or short. That\u2019s because this is a property of the\ncontent and style of presentation. For example, \u201cA survey on white tennis\nballs\u201d or \u201cWhite tennis balls, a survey in colored pictures\u201d, etc. In fact, if\nyour title is \u201cA short survey on tennis ball colors\u201d, that would mean that your\nsurvey is short in content, as in \u201cbrief, incomplete\u201d, rather than in length \u2013\nan important info for the reader to know.\u201d\n3.3. Abstract.",
        "Foreword. If the Introduction is relatively short (say, under 3 pages), you are\nprobably ok. But if you followed the rules above and it\u2019s still over 4 pages, that\nprobably means your paper is quite long, you have too many results, and/or the paper\nspans several sub-areas of mathematics which all have plenty of relevant background. In this case you should divide your Introduction into subsections, and I suggest using\nForeword as the \ufb01rst subsection. Think of it as a nontechnical introduction to your\nIntroduction. Ordinarily, this function would be played by the Abstract, but we already\nmentioned that it\u2019s governed by its own very constraining rules. Consider putting in the Foreword some highly literary description of what you are\ndoing. If it\u2019s beautiful or su\ufb03ciently memorable, it might be quoted in other papers,\nsometimes on a barely related subject, and bring some extra clicks to your work. Feel\nfree to discuss the big picture, NSF project outline style, mention some motivational\nexamples in other \ufb01elds of study, general physical or philosophical principles underlying\nyour work, etc. There is no other place in the paper to do this, and I doubt referees\nwould object if you keep your Foreword under one page. For now such discussions are\nrelegated to surveys and monographs, which is a shame since as a result some interesting\nperspectives of many people are missing. Note: even if your paper is short, you can still get away with writing the \ufb01rst paragraph\nof the Introduction in this style. In fact, I encourage you to do this. Nothing is less\ninspiring than a paper which starts \u201cLet G = (V, E) be a loopless graph on n vertices.\u201d\nRead [18] and other writing guides about how to write the \ufb01rst sentence. Note that\nsince math writing tends to be so rigid, this is your only place to shine.",
        "In the\nexample, the Introduction should have only [A] and [B] papers mentioned.8\n4.4. Where to cite a paper? That\u2019s actually easy. Only the most relevant papers\nshould be cited in the Introduction. The rest are cited in the Final Remarks. Nothing\nis cited in the main part of the paper. The reason is simple \u2013 there is no way to be both\nfair, clear and complete when citing in the middle of the paper, and without breaking\nthe \ufb02ow of the arguments. Major Exception: you are using somebody\u2019s result as a\nlemma in the proof. Then a precise reference is required, but don\u2019t elaborate on it. If\nyou want to tell a story of this result, who did what towards it, etc. \u2013 make a separate\nRemark after the proof, or postpone it until Final Remarks. There is also the dynamic updating advantage in this approach. Once you make\nyour paper public, inevitably your colleague XYZ will send you a barely related recent\npaper you may want to cite since you actually like XYZ and respect his opinion. Or\nperhaps PQR tells you about some simple special case she worked out and published as\na lemma back in 1995. While PQR\u2019s tools do not extend to your most general version,\nyou should de\ufb01nitely cite it and explain why they don\u2019t. In all these cases, you know\nexactly where these updates go in the paper. 4.5.",
        "Acknowledgements. Rota advises \u201cGive lavish acknowledgments\u201d and this is\nmostly correct. Let me expound on that a bit. You still need to make choices when\nyou thank everyone. Make a short unnumbered section at the end of the paper, right\nbefore the References. It\u2019s ok to have it in a smaller font. Proceed in the order of increasing importance.

With the ever increasing competition for\njobs, publishing in top journals, etc., some of the old advice needs to be calibrated and\nadjusted for modern times. This is particularly true about typesetting in LaTeX which\nis universal and represents its own advantages and challenges. While most advice in [9]\nstill applies, it feels overwhelming and somewhat stale, while the TeX-nology part is\nsurprisingly incomplete. To make further contrast with older works, one no longer expects their papers to be\nall that interesting to survive decades. It\u2019s the short term goals that became all too\nimportant. Thus the emphasis should be on a modest goal of clear rather than perfect\nwriting. The same applies to reading. With the rapidly increasing growth in the number of\npublications, nobody has time nor patience to read all relevant papers. Some people\nread many titles on the arXiv, only occasionally reading the abstracts. Some quickly\nskim most papers in their areas, but read none carefully. Some just read the intro-\nductions. Some read whatever is suggested by Google Scholar with its obvious bias\ntowards citations of their own papers. Some skip everything in the paper and go straight\nto main results; if su\ufb03ciently interested, they then go back to read what\u2019s it all about.

First and foremost, do NOT use BibTeX, unless you are\nan advanced user and know exactly what you are doing. Even if you have hundreds\nof references, or especially if you do. MathSciNet citations tend to be bloated with\nunnecessary details and have inconsistent style and author\u2019s spelling. For example,\nsome papers have \u201cPaul Erd\u02ddos\u201d, while others \u201cErd\u00a8os, P.\u201d, making it unclear if that\u2019s\nthe same person. You should pick a style and stick to it. Make each reference as concise\nas possible, yet complete enough to be found. For example, abbreviate author\u2019s \ufb01rst\nnames, omit titles of book series and issue numbers, etc. These are all redundant. Physics paper are champions at this; they even omit the titles. I feel this is going too\nfar. Second, for longer papers use alphanumeric style, as in [SY09,Woo96]. It helps the\nreader to know the name and date of the publication. For unpublished papers, use\n[Con17+]. For papers with 5 or more authors, use [A+13] in place of [ABCDEF13]. For papers with the same names and dates use [Tra15a], [Tra15b], etc. Thirdly, this is perhaps obvious, but do not emulate Knuth. While he strives for\nperfection, you need to worry about clarity.

So why do we need this new guide then? I don\u2019t have a concise answer for\nthat. I think the world is changing too fast. With the ever increasing competition for\njobs, publishing in top journals, etc., some of the old advice needs to be calibrated and\nadjusted for modern times. This is particularly true about typesetting in LaTeX which\nis universal and represents its own advantages and challenges. While most advice in [9]\nstill applies, it feels overwhelming and somewhat stale, while the TeX-nology part is\nsurprisingly incomplete. To make further contrast with older works, one no longer expects their papers to be\nall that interesting to survive decades. It\u2019s the short term goals that became all too\nimportant. Thus the emphasis should be on a modest goal of clear rather than perfect\nwriting. The same applies to reading. With the rapidly increasing growth in the number of\npublications, nobody has time nor patience to read all relevant papers. Some people\nread many titles on the arXiv, only occasionally reading the abstracts. Some quickly\nskim most papers in their areas, but read none carefully. Some just read the intro-\nductions. Some read whatever is suggested by Google Scholar with its obvious bias\ntowards citations of their own papers. Some skip everything in the paper and go straight\nto main results; if su\ufb03ciently interested, they then go back to read what\u2019s it all about. Some read nothing at all and learn about new work at seminars, conferences, etc. So if\nyou want to increase your readership and enhance their reading experience, the papers\nneed to be written in a new manner compared to old style guides, to appeal to all these\ndiverse readership styles. 3.

The Final Remarks section should be neatly divided into untitled subsections, each\nbetween one-two paragraphs and a page at the most (writing \\subsection{} will pro-\nduce a number without a title).

Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so.

First and foremost, do NOT use BibTeX, unless you are\nan advanced user and know exactly what you are doing. Even if you have hundreds\nof references, or especially if you do. MathSciNet citations tend to be bloated with\nunnecessary details and have inconsistent style and author\u2019s spelling.

For example, abbreviate author\u2019s \ufb01rst\nnames, omit titles of book series and issue numbers, etc. These are all redundant. Physics paper are champions at this; they even omit the titles. I feel this is going too\nfar. Second, for longer papers use alphanumeric style, as in [SY09,Woo96]. It helps the\nreader to know the name and date of the publication. For unpublished papers, use\n[Con17+]. For papers with 5 or more authors, use [A+13] in place of [ABCDEF13]. For papers with the same names and dates use [Tra15a], [Tra15b], etc. Thirdly, this is perhaps obvious, but do not emulate Knuth. While he strives for\nperfection, you need to worry about clarity.

        "HOW TO WRITE A CLEAR MATH PAPER\n17\nSecond, if at all possible, consider the simplest yet still nontrivial special case of your\nresult. If you can extract a little result which can be stated in the language that high\nschool or college students can understand and possibly solve by a direct argument, make\nit into an olympiad style problem. Send it to somebody on your national math olympiad\ncommittee (which comprise IMO), or the Putnam committee. They are always looking\nfor good and unusual problems, and many problems are in fact created this way. Third, if the problem you extract is too di\ufb03cult for the Putnam Competition, but\nyour argument in this case substantially simpli\ufb01es, write it up in a separate note. Try\nto make it accessible to undergraduates. Submit it to Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Intelligencer, Math. Magazine, or another journal targeting students and teachers. If\nyou explain at the end how this special case \ufb01ts into your paper, this will clarify and\nbring more exposure to your work. 6.3. Rewrite and republish. Finally, suppose you already wrote and published the\npaper. You think it\u2019s being ignored because it\u2019s unclear. Well, rewrite it. Simplify\nall the arguments, maybe generalize the main result a bit, \ufb01nd some new examples or\napplications. And publish this new version, even if just on the arXiv. Rota advises to publish the same paper several times, and gives some famous exam-\nples [13]. While I disagree with this practice, I think there is a room for compromise. Say, for example, in your latest paper the argument is cumbersome because you are\novergeneralizing. It is then ok to start with a proof of a known theorem \u201cfor com-\npleteness\u201d and then explain how this proof needs to be modi\ufb01ed to work in greater\ngenerality. That way you get the best of both worlds: a clear presentation of your own\nold result and a clear pathway to your new generalization. Acknowledgements. I am grateful to Bruce Berndt, Skip Garibaldi, Steven Krantz,",
        "Acknowledgements. Rota advises \u201cGive lavish acknowledgments\u201d and this is\nmostly correct. Let me expound on that a bit. You still need to make choices when\nyou thank everyone. Make a short unnumbered section at the end of the paper, right\nbefore the References. It\u2019s ok to have it in a smaller font. Proceed in the order of increasing importance. First, thank everyone you remember\ndiscussing the results in the paper whether or not you remember them actually giving\nhelpful suggestions. Do this by name, in alphabetical order, as in \u201cWe are grateful to\nFreddie Mercury, Ozzy Osbourne, Axl Rose and Stephen Tyler for helpful conversa-\ntions\u201d. Note that it\u2019s ok to use nicknames and commonly used names rather than full\nlegal names (in this example, Freddie is actually Farrokh, Axl\u2019s real name is William,\nand \u201cOzzy\u201d is a nickname). When in doubt, consult emails from a person and use the\nname as it appears in the sign o\ufb00line. Second, single out people who gave you some really helpful suggestions. Say so,\nas in \u201cWe are especially thankful to Adam Smith for informing us about his invisible\nhand Lemma; this result played a crucial role in our laissez-faire equilibrium analysis in\nSection 3, leading to a much shorter proof of Theorem 3.4.\u201d Do this one by one, for all\nsuch people, in any order (the explanations stand for themselves). Some guides advise\nyou to email each person to ask permission before thanking. Ignore that. However,\ndo ask by email for permission if you are using any private information, like e.g. the\nconjecture this person once told you. Do not get upset if you receive a reply \u201cplease\nremove that conjecture, I am still working on it\u201d. Do as requested then. Conclude with thanking the institutions that hosted you which facilitated collabora-\ntion (if any), and then all granting agencies supporting you. 4.",

An example: \u201cConsider an integer x,\nwhose square is 4, and which is positive.\u201d In other words, every time you make a\nclause, subclause, etc., put commas on both sides.

Here is an example of how this\nworks:\nOur Theorem 3 studies partitions into even primes. A strongly related re-\nsult in [A] studies partitions into into primes which are powers of two. This\npaper builds on the tools in [B], which studies partitions into primes which are\nsquares.

In an unusual development, last year [F]\nproved uncomputability of the partition function into odd perfect numbers,\nbut the paper remains under scrutiny (my colleague Kiran X. has been un-\nsuccessful in independently verifying the result). We should also mention a\nseries of papers [G1,G2,G3] on partitions into prime Catalan numbers, which\nsuccessively improves on the classical bound in [H] by using...

Well, I have seen the intro-\nductions with no stated results. They work only if they are short (under 1.5 pages),\nand the paper is itself a note (at most 10 pp).

So why do we need this new guide then? I don\u2019t have a concise answer for\nthat. I think the world is changing too fast. With the ever increasing competition for\njobs, publishing in top journals, etc., some of the old advice needs to be calibrated and\nadjusted for modern times. This is particularly true about typesetting in LaTeX which\nis universal and represents its own advantages and challenges. While most advice in [9]\nstill applies, it feels overwhelming and somewhat stale, while the TeX-nology part is\nsurprisingly incomplete. To make further contrast with older works, one no longer expects their papers to be\nall that interesting to survive decades. It\u2019s the short term goals that became all too\nimportant. Thus the emphasis should be on a modest goal of clear rather than perfect\nwriting. The same applies to reading. With the rapidly increasing growth in the number of\npublications, nobody has time nor patience to read all relevant papers. Some people\nread many titles on the arXiv, only occasionally reading the abstracts. Some quickly\nskim most papers in their areas, but read none carefully. Some just read the intro-\nductions. Some read whatever is suggested by Google Scholar with its obvious bias\ntowards citations of their own papers. Some skip everything in the paper and go straight\nto main results; if su\ufb03ciently interested, they then go back to read what\u2019s it all about. Some read nothing at all and learn about new work at seminars, conferences, etc. So if\nyou want to increase your readership and enhance their reading experience, the papers\nneed to be written in a new manner compared to old style guides, to appeal to all these\ndiverse readership styles. 3.

This helps neither the\nreaders to \ufb01nd anything at all, nor the authors of 2\u201319 to get credit; in fact, it pits them\nagainst each other by unfairly equalizing their research contributions. What you should\ndo is go over the papers individually, starting with the most important reference, and\ndescribe their contribution. Stop when you are tired. Here is an example of how this\nworks:\nOur Theorem 3 studies partitions into even primes. A strongly related re-\nsult in [A] studies partitions into into primes which are powers of two. This\npaper builds on the tools in [B], which studies partitions into primes which are\nsquares.

        "1.3. Why be clear? Now that we framed it as a tradeo\ufb00between your time and\ne\ufb00ort, and that of the readers, this is no longer an obvious question and it deserves a\nfull explanation. And the key observation is \u2013 being clear is not about you! You must\nthink of the reader and how they will read your paper. Imagine a graduate student at a small university with poor English skills. He is\nreading your paper. If confused on page 3, he is likely to give up and never \ufb01nish the\nreading. He might use an older paper with a weaker result for his research, just because\nit\u2019s better written.

Conclusion: you didn\u2019t\nmake her spend 1 extra min \u2013 you lost both the citation and a chance to advance the\narea. Let me mention two more reasons which are variations on the same theme. For junior\nmathematicians: clear writing will make people take you seriously. It is pretty easy for\nlazy senior scientists to brush o\ufb00a paper on the subject with ambiguous results and\nuncertain proofs. But when you are clear they have no excuse.

First, thank everyone you remember\ndiscussing the results in the paper whether or not you remember them actually giving\nhelpful suggestions. Do this by name, in alphabetical order, as in \u201cWe are grateful to\nFreddie Mercury, Ozzy Osbourne, Axl Rose and Stephen Tyler for helpful conversa-\ntions\u201d. Note that it\u2019s ok to use nicknames and commonly used names rather than full\nlegal names (in this example, Freddie is actually Farrokh, Axl\u2019s real name is William,\nand \u201cOzzy\u201d is a nickname). When in doubt, consult emails from a person and use the\nname as it appears in the sign o\ufb00line. Second, single out people who gave you some really helpful suggestions. Say so,\nas in \u201cWe are especially thankful to Adam Smith for informing us about his invisible\nhand Lemma; this result played a crucial role in our laissez-faire equilibrium analysis in\nSection 3, leading to a much shorter proof of Theorem 3.4.\u201d Do this one by one, for all\nsuch people, in any order (the explanations stand for themselves). Some guides advise\nyou to email each person to ask permission before thanking. Ignore that. However,\ndo ask by email for permission if you are using any private information, like e.g. the\nconjecture this person once told you. Do not get upset if you receive a reply \u201cplease\nremove that conjecture, I am still working on it\u201d. Do as requested then. Conclude with thanking the institutions that hosted you which facilitated collabora-\ntion (if any), and then all granting agencies supporting you. 4.",

So why do we need this new guide then? I don\u2019t have a concise answer for\nthat. I think the world is changing too fast. With the ever increasing competition for\njobs, publishing in top journals, etc., some of the old advice needs to be calibrated and\nadjusted for modern times. This is particularly true about typesetting in LaTeX which\nis universal and represents its own advantages and challenges. While most advice in [9]\nstill applies, it feels overwhelming and somewhat stale, while the TeX-nology part is\nsurprisingly incomplete. To make further contrast with older works, one no longer expects their papers to be\nall that interesting to survive decades. It\u2019s the short term goals that became all too\nimportant. Thus the emphasis should be on a modest goal of clear rather than perfect\nwriting. The same applies to reading. With the rapidly increasing growth in the number of\npublications, nobody has time nor patience to read all relevant papers. Some people\nread many titles on the arXiv, only occasionally reading the abstracts. Some quickly\nskim most papers in their areas, but read none carefully. Some just read the intro-\nductions. Some read whatever is suggested by Google Scholar with its obvious bias\ntowards citations of their own papers. Some skip everything in the paper and go straight\nto main results; if su\ufb03ciently interested, they then go back to read what\u2019s it all about. Some read nothing at all and learn about new work at seminars, conferences, etc. So if\nyou want to increase your readership and enhance their reading experience, the papers\nneed to be written in a new manner compared to old style guides, to appeal to all these\ndiverse readership styles. 3. Macro tips\n3.1. Structure of the paper. Every newspaper writing guide, including the above",
        "HOW TO WRITE A CLEAR MATH PAPER\n7\nWhat not to include: Technical de\ufb01nitions, examples, big \ufb01gures illustrating some spe-\ncial cases, etc. Instead, whenever relevant and you feel like including them, use \u201c(see\nFigure 5.1)\u201d or \u201c(see the exact de\ufb01nition in \u00a73.4)\u201d to get your point across.

Also, ignore Rota\u2019s \u201cgiving everybody his due\u201d advice \u2013 it\u2019s no longer applicable as\nstated. Most likely, there are too many relevant papers, so it\u2019s impossible to do this\nin the introduction and control its length. Instead, explain the history that\u2019s directly\nrelevant to your main result. For example, \u201cPaper [A] asked about XYZ and proved\nweak-XYZ. Last year, paper [B] showed that strong-XYZ is false. In this paper we\nre\ufb01ne the tools in [B] to show that XYZ is also false. We conjecture that the weak-\nXYZ is the strongest possible result in this direction. We also analyze the examples in\n[C] and show that...\u201d You get the idea. In the last paragraph or subsection of the Introduction, outline the structure of the\npaper in your own words.

The Final Remarks section should be neatly divided into untitled subsections, each\nbetween one-two paragraphs and a page at the most (writing \\subsection{} will pro-\nduce a number without a title). The subsections need not have any relation to each\nother, but should be ordered in decreasing order of importance.

The referee was annoyed, but we kept the name just because it\u2019s amusing and\nmemorable. Finally, let me self-quote the title naming advice I gave on MathOverflow, with some\npossibly useful examples of titles:4\n\u201cYou should emphasize not the length but the content.

If your note is a new\nsimple proof, and this is what you want to emphasize, make the title \u201cShort\nproof that all tennis balls are white\u201d. If there was a conjecture that all tennis\nballs were white and you found a counterexample, use \u201cNot all tennis balls are\nwhite\u201d.

That\u2019s because this is a property of the\ncontent and style of presentation. For example, \u201cA survey on white tennis\nballs\u201d or \u201cWhite tennis balls, a survey in colored pictures\u201d, etc. In fact, if\nyour title is \u201cA short survey on tennis ball colors\u201d, that would mean that your\nsurvey is short in content, as in \u201cbrief, incomplete\u201d, rather than in length \u2013\nan important info for the reader to know.\u201d\n3.3.

        "Introduction. This is the hardest section to write. It\u2019s probably the only part of\nyour paper that will be read by all but a few most devoted readers. If you have a senior\ncoauthor, ask her or him to write this. If you don\u2019t, ask a senior colleague to read it\nand comment on your draft. Start writing your paper by writing the \ufb01rst draft of the\nIntroduction, so you have an idea what\u2019s in the paper, and completely rewrite it after\nthe rest of the paper is written. More often than not, the paper turns up di\ufb00erently\nthan you initially imagined it. This could be for technical reasons, or since you proved\nmore results, or now understand your own results much better than when you started\nwriting. Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the\nhistory of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly out-\nlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way\ntowards getting us a couple of readers.\u201d\nAs I explained earlier, the problem with this approach is that \u201cnowadays\u201d some people\ndon\u2019t even have patience to read a long introduction. So what should you do? Well,\nmake a lengthy introduction, Rota\u2013style, extract a few pages to keep in the introduction\nand the rest put into Final Remarks. Alternatively, use a Foreword. More on these\nlater. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these",
        "12\nIGOR PAK\n4.3. How to cite a list of papers. It is a disservice to the community to write \u201cSee\n[2\u201319] for some relevant work\u201d, as I see in some sloppy papers. This helps neither the\nreaders to \ufb01nd anything at all, nor the authors of 2\u201319 to get credit; in fact, it pits them\nagainst each other by unfairly equalizing their research contributions. What you should\ndo is go over the papers individually, starting with the most important reference, and\ndescribe their contribution. Stop when you are tired. Here is an example of how this\nworks:\nOur Theorem 3 studies partitions into even primes. A strongly related re-\nsult in [A] studies partitions into into primes which are powers of two. This\npaper builds on the tools in [B], which studies partitions into primes which are\nsquares. In a di\ufb00erent direction, partitions into even Fermat primes have been\nstudied in [C,D], and more recently in [E], which under the GRH established\nWigner\u2019s semicircle law in this case. In an unusual development, last year [F]\nproved uncomputability of the partition function into odd perfect numbers,\nbut the paper remains under scrutiny (my colleague Kiran X. has been un-\nsuccessful in independently verifying the result). We should also mention a\nseries of papers [G1,G2,G3] on partitions into prime Catalan numbers, which\nsuccessively improves on the classical bound in [H] by using... As we mentioned earlier, this type of description should go into Final Remarks.",
        "While, of\ncourse, one should make an e\ufb00ort and try to avoid some easy pitfalls, that\u2019s not exactly\nwhat I am talking about. The rest of the paper is really a long answer to this question. But let us \ufb01rst take a step back and answer more basic questions. 1.2. Being clear \u2013 how hard can that be? Well, it can be easy. But it can also be\npretty hard, especially if you are an inexperienced writer. The trouble with being clear\nas a concept, is that most people think it doesn\u2019t take time. They think one naturally\nbecomes a better writer. Quite the opposite is true. Making your paper clearer takes\ntime and a lot of e\ufb00ort. You learn to do this faster of course, but it\u2019s still a slow process. I once asked Noga Alon how did he get to be so good (and so fast!) at writing. He said\n\u201cit gets easier after the \ufb01rst 300 papers\u201d. Now, as it always happens, the real test of your commitment to clarity is not when\nit\u2019s easy, but when it\u2019s hard. Imagine the following scenario. While \ufb01nishing your paper\nyou realized that in some sections you use h as a variable, and in other sections h is a\nfunction. And on the very last page you had to write h(h) which is just awful. What\nshould you do? Should you spend maybe 30 min going over every instance of h in the\npaper and renaming it accordingly? Can\u2019t you just make a disclaimer at the beginning\n\u22c6Department of Mathematics, UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, 90095. Email: pak(@math).ucla.edu. 1Mathematically, this statement is completely false. But that\u2019s part of my point \u2013 how would anyone\neven know that in the second version? When you are unclear, all claims look reasonably true. 1",
        "1.3. Why be clear? Now that we framed it as a tradeo\ufb00between your time and\ne\ufb00ort, and that of the readers, this is no longer an obvious question and it deserves a\nfull explanation. And the key observation is \u2013 being clear is not about you! You must\nthink of the reader and how they will read your paper. Imagine a graduate student at a small university with poor English skills. He is\nreading your paper. If confused on page 3, he is likely to give up and never \ufb01nish the\nreading.

For junior\nmathematicians: clear writing will make people take you seriously. It is pretty easy for\nlazy senior scientists to brush o\ufb00a paper on the subject with ambiguous results and\nuncertain proofs. But when you are clear they have no excuse. Don\u2019t give them one! Forget that they themselves have been publishing sloppy writing for decades. You are\nnot competing on the same level (yet).

Keep the .pdf \ufb01le with slides alongside.19 Try\nto explain the gist on your blog, even if it\u2019s mostly dormant and has no subscribers. Again, link the blog entry to your website alongside the paper. There are a few more things you can do, all of them harder. First, write a survey\non the subject. If you want to do a good job, this takes a lot of hard work. But you\ncan learn a great deal and are able to place your results into context where they would\nbe better understood.

This\nis correct but also misses the point \u2013 you are not supposed to read the Final Remarks\nin order. Sometimes referees and editors object to the size of Final Remarks section,\nwhich tends to grow rather large. There are several ways of dealing with this which are\nbest used in combination. First, you can extract some lengthy subsections and form new sections titled \u201cOpen\nproblems\u201d or \u201cHistorical overview\u201d which would be placed right before the Final Re-\nmarks. Second, you can simply remove some of them to appease the journal, but keep\nthe full length version on the arXiv or your webpage. Remember \u2013 nobody cares what\nversion you publish in the journal as long as the theorems/proofs are the same. Third,\nyou can preclude the objections proactively by changing the font size of the Final Re-\nmarks section to \\small or even \\footnotesize.

        "Introduction. This is the hardest section to write. It\u2019s probably the only part of\nyour paper that will be read by all but a few most devoted readers. If you have a senior\ncoauthor, ask her or him to write this. If you don\u2019t, ask a senior colleague to read it\nand comment on your draft. Start writing your paper by writing the \ufb01rst draft of the\nIntroduction, so you have an idea what\u2019s in the paper, and completely rewrite it after\nthe rest of the paper is written. More often than not, the paper turns up di\ufb00erently\nthan you initially imagined it. This could be for technical reasons, or since you proved\nmore results, or now understand your own results much better than when you started\nwriting. Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the\nhistory of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly out-\nlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way\ntowards getting us a couple of readers.\u201d\nAs I explained earlier, the problem with this approach is that \u201cnowadays\u201d some people\ndon\u2019t even have patience to read a long introduction. So what should you do? Well,\nmake a lengthy introduction, Rota\u2013style, extract a few pages to keep in the introduction\nand the rest put into Final Remarks. Alternatively, use a Foreword. More on these\nlater. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these",
        "HOW TO WRITE A CLEAR MATH PAPER\n17\nSecond, if at all possible, consider the simplest yet still nontrivial special case of your\nresult. If you can extract a little result which can be stated in the language that high\nschool or college students can understand and possibly solve by a direct argument, make\nit into an olympiad style problem. Send it to somebody on your national math olympiad\ncommittee (which comprise IMO), or the Putnam committee. They are always looking\nfor good and unusual problems, and many problems are in fact created this way. Third, if the problem you extract is too di\ufb03cult for the Putnam Competition, but\nyour argument in this case substantially simpli\ufb01es, write it up in a separate note. Try\nto make it accessible to undergraduates. Submit it to Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Intelligencer, Math. Magazine, or another journal targeting students and teachers. If\nyou explain at the end how this special case \ufb01ts into your paper, this will clarify and\nbring more exposure to your work. 6.3. Rewrite and republish. Finally, suppose you already wrote and published the\npaper. You think it\u2019s being ignored because it\u2019s unclear. Well, rewrite it. Simplify\nall the arguments, maybe generalize the main result a bit, \ufb01nd some new examples or\napplications. And publish this new version, even if just on the arXiv. Rota advises to publish the same paper several times, and gives some famous exam-\nples [13]. While I disagree with this practice, I think there is a room for compromise. Say, for example, in your latest paper the argument is cumbersome because you are\novergeneralizing. It is then ok to start with a proof of a known theorem \u201cfor com-\npleteness\u201d and then explain how this proof needs to be modi\ufb01ed to work in greater\ngenerality. That way you get the best of both worlds: a clear presentation of your own\nold result and a clear pathway to your new generalization. Acknowledgements.

        "Foreword. If the Introduction is relatively short (say, under 3 pages), you are\nprobably ok. But if you followed the rules above and it\u2019s still over 4 pages, that\nprobably means your paper is quite long, you have too many results, and/or the paper\nspans several sub-areas of mathematics which all have plenty of relevant background. In this case you should divide your Introduction into subsections, and I suggest using\nForeword as the \ufb01rst subsection. Think of it as a nontechnical introduction to your\nIntroduction. Ordinarily, this function would be played by the Abstract, but we already\nmentioned that it\u2019s governed by its own very constraining rules. Consider putting in the Foreword some highly literary description of what you are\ndoing. If it\u2019s beautiful or su\ufb03ciently memorable, it might be quoted in other papers,\nsometimes on a barely related subject, and bring some extra clicks to your work. Feel\nfree to discuss the big picture, NSF project outline style, mention some motivational\nexamples in other \ufb01elds of study, general physical or philosophical principles underlying\nyour work, etc. There is no other place in the paper to do this, and I doubt referees\nwould object if you keep your Foreword under one page. For now such discussions are\nrelegated to surveys and monographs, which is a shame since as a result some interesting\nperspectives of many people are missing. Note: even if your paper is short, you can still get away with writing the \ufb01rst paragraph\nof the Introduction in this style. In fact, I encourage you to do this. Nothing is less\ninspiring than a paper which starts \u201cLet G = (V, E) be a loopless graph on n vertices.\u201d\nRead [18] and other writing guides about how to write the \ufb01rst sentence.

Well, I have seen the intro-\nductions with no stated results. They work only if they are short (under 1.5 pages),\nand the paper is itself a note (at most 10 pp).

We conjecture that the weak-\nXYZ is the strongest possible result in this direction. We also analyze the examples in\n[C] and show that...\u201d You get the idea. In the last paragraph or subsection of the Introduction, outline the structure of the\npaper in your own words. In the absence of the table of content, this helps the reader\nto navigate the paper and use section links visible in the Adobe Reader. 3.6.",
        "later. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these\nresults \u2013 include them. If you are resolving a conjecture or a question \u2013 state it (with\nattribution). But do aim to have your \ufb01rst theorem on the \ufb01rst page, or at worst on\nthe second page. Sometimes this doesn\u2019t work. For example, there are too many details in the def-\ninitions, the theorems are long and cumbersome to state, the main result could be a\nbijection which takes very long to state, the context or the history is too long, etc. Sometimes it\u2019s a tradition in a particularly technical area. Well, I have seen the intro-\nductions with no stated results. They work only if they are short (under 1.5 pages),\nand the paper is itself a note (at most 10 pp). The best way to get around stating technicalities in the main result is to skip the\nmain theorem altogether and include interesting, nontrivial, but easy to state corollaries\nof main results. Cook them up if necessary and think of them as an advertisement of\nyour paper, even if nobody ever cared to ask about this special case. This corollary is all\nthat the paper passers-by will remember and when prompted can tell other people. If\nthere is no such result in the Introduction, they remember nothing other than \u201cperhaps\nthis recent preprint is relevant to Q\u2019s work\u201d, which is much too weak as a clue to tell\nto Q.",
        "Also, this approach might raise some eyebrows of the referees. At one point,\nmy coauthor and I invented Gayley polytopes named after a street I lived on, and to\nrhyme with Cayley polytopes of which they were Generalizations to all Graphs G (get\nit?) The referee was annoyed, but we kept the name just because it\u2019s amusing and\nmemorable. Finally, let me self-quote the title naming advice I gave on MathOverflow, with some\npossibly useful examples of titles:4\n\u201cYou should emphasize not the length but the content. If you prove that\nall tennis balls are white make the title \u201cAll tennis balls are white\u201d. If you\nprove that some tennis balls are white, title your note \u201cOn white tennis balls\u201d,\nor \u201cNew examples of white tennis balls\u201d, or whatever. If your note is a new\nsimple proof, and this is what you want to emphasize, make the title \u201cShort\nproof that all tennis balls are white\u201d. If there was a conjecture that all tennis\nballs were white and you found a counterexample, use \u201cNot all tennis balls are\nwhite\u201d. If you study further properties of white tennis balls, use \u201cA remark\non white tennis balls\u201d. You see the idea. \u201cOn the other hand, if you wrote a survey, it\u2019s important to emphasize that,\nregardless whether it\u2019s long or short. That\u2019s because this is a property of the\ncontent and style of presentation. For example, \u201cA survey on white tennis\nballs\u201d or \u201cWhite tennis balls, a survey in colored pictures\u201d, etc. In fact, if\nyour title is \u201cA short survey on tennis ball colors\u201d, that would mean that your\nsurvey is short in content, as in \u201cbrief, incomplete\u201d, rather than in length \u2013\nan important info for the reader to know.\u201d\n3.3. Abstract.",
        "Introduction. This is the hardest section to write. It\u2019s probably the only part of\nyour paper that will be read by all but a few most devoted readers. If you have a senior\ncoauthor, ask her or him to write this. If you don\u2019t, ask a senior colleague to read it\nand comment on your draft. Start writing your paper by writing the \ufb01rst draft of the\nIntroduction, so you have an idea what\u2019s in the paper, and completely rewrite it after\nthe rest of the paper is written. More often than not, the paper turns up di\ufb00erently\nthan you initially imagined it. This could be for technical reasons, or since you proved\nmore results, or now understand your own results much better than when you started\nwriting. Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the\nhistory of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly out-\nlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way\ntowards getting us a couple of readers.\u201d\nAs I explained earlier, the problem with this approach is that \u201cnowadays\u201d some people\ndon\u2019t even have patience to read a long introduction. So what should you do? Well,\nmake a lengthy introduction, Rota\u2013style, extract a few pages to keep in the introduction\nand the rest put into Final Remarks. Alternatively, use a Foreword. More on these\nlater. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these",
        "Where to start\n2.1. Not with this article, but with other literature. Mathematical writing tends\nto be so poor, no wonder there are so many very good guides. These include famous es-\nsays by Halmos et al. [4], and nice books by Higham [5], Knuth [9] and Krantz [10]. More\nrecent guides we want to mention are by Berndt [2], Goldreich [3] and S. P. Jones [8]. Further essays and resources are included on Terry Tao\u2019s blog [16]. 2.2. Read a good guide on writing non\ufb01ction. I strongly recommend Zinsser\u2019s\nbook [18] in part because I don\u2019t know any other, but in part because it\u2019s so well\nwritten I can\u2019t imagine a better guide. To get the taste, here is a short section on how\nto organize your paragraphs, see [18, p. 80]. Most of this applies to math papers with\nminor adjustments:\n\u201cKeep your paragraphs short. Writing is visual\u2014it catches the eye before\nit has a chance to catch the brain. Short paragraphs put air around what you\nwrite and make it look inviting, whereas a long chunk of type can discourage\na reader from even starting to read. \u201cNewspaper paragraphs should be only two or three sentences long; news-\npaper type is set in a narrow width, and the inches quickly add up. You may\nthink such frequent paragraphing will damage the development of your point. Obviously The New Yorker is obsessed by this fear\u2014a reader can go for miles\nwithout relief. Don\u2019t worry; the gains far outweigh the hazards. \u201cBut don\u2019t go berserk. A succession of tiny paragraphs is as annoying as\na paragraph that\u2019s too long. I\u2019m thinking of all those midget paragraphs\u2014\nverbless wonders\u2014written by modern journalists trying to make their articles\nquick \u2019n\u2019 easy. Actually they make the reader\u2019s job harder by chopping up a\nnatural train of thought.\u201d\nLet me tailor my advice. If you are a native English speaker, read Zinsser before\nanything else and take his advice to heart. Think of it this way: Zinsser\u2019s book is to\nmathematical writing as good foundation is to a perfect makeup. Now, if you are are",
        "continue reading. This is exactly how the endnotes work. Over the years, I have seen many objections to this approach. \u201cDevoting subsections\nto each paragraph makes this last section feel very disjointed,\u201d wrote one referee. This\nis correct but also misses the point \u2013 you are not supposed to read the Final Remarks\nin order. Sometimes referees and editors object to the size of Final Remarks section,\nwhich tends to grow rather large. There are several ways of dealing with this which are\nbest used in combination. First, you can extract some lengthy subsections and form new sections titled \u201cOpen\nproblems\u201d or \u201cHistorical overview\u201d which would be placed right before the Final Re-\nmarks. Second, you can simply remove some of them to appease the journal, but keep\nthe full length version on the arXiv or your webpage. Remember \u2013 nobody cares what\nversion you publish in the journal as long as the theorems/proofs are the same. Third,\nyou can preclude the objections proactively by changing the font size of the Final Re-\nmarks section to \\small or even \\footnotesize. I can see you squinting, but it\u2019s \ufb01ne,\nreally. Human eye is a fantastic instrument. If people can read YouTube comments on\n5Warning: in CS Theory papers, the Conclusions section plays a di\ufb00erent role (cf. [3])."

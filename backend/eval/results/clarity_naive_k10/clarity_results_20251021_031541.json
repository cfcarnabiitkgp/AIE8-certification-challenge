So why do we need this new guide then? I don\u2019t have a concise answer for\nthat. I think the world is changing too fast. With the ever increasing competition for\njobs, publishing in top journals, etc., some of the old advice needs to be calibrated and\nadjusted for modern times. This is particularly true about typesetting in LaTeX which\nis universal and represents its own advantages and challenges. While most advice in [9]\nstill applies, it feels overwhelming and somewhat stale, while the TeX-nology part is\nsurprisingly incomplete. To make further contrast with older works, one no longer expects their papers to be\nall that interesting to survive decades. It\u2019s the short term goals that became all too\nimportant. Thus the emphasis should be on a modest goal of clear rather than perfect\nwriting. The same applies to reading. With the rapidly increasing growth in the number of\npublications, nobody has time nor patience to read all relevant papers. Some people\nread many titles on the arXiv, only occasionally reading the abstracts. Some quickly\nskim most papers in their areas, but read none carefully. Some just read the intro-\nductions. Some read whatever is suggested by Google Scholar with its obvious bias\ntowards citations of their own papers. Some skip everything in the paper and go straight\nto main results; if su\ufb03ciently interested, they then go back to read what\u2019s it all about. Some read nothing at all and learn about new work at seminars, conferences, etc. So if\nyou want to increase your readership and enhance their reading experience, the papers\nneed to be written in a new manner compared to old style guides, to appeal to all these\ndiverse readership styles. 3.

        "This is the easiest section to write. Just think of a short MathSciNet\nsummary (not a longer more careful review they have sometimes). The abstract should\nhave nothing personal, just dry facts about the results. State key results \ufb01rst and\nbrie\ufb02y mention the existence of others, including some generalizations, but no need for\nprecise statements. Provide no details and no connections to other works unless abso-\nlutely necessary. Some journal guidelines advise not to include any citations, though\nI personally see no harm is writing \u201cWe disprove a conjecture stated by the author in\n[Pak12],\u201d since this is more precise than \u201cstated by the author in 2012\u201d (is this the date\nof the idea? of the talk where the conjecture was \ufb01rst stated? of the arXiv preprint,\nor what?)\nEither way, no need to worry about the abstract too much, but do put some minor\ne\ufb00ort into it. Remember \u2013 large fraction of MathSciNet reviews are just the abstracts,\nso make it clear, precise, plain and uninventive. As a rule of thumb, the number of\nlines in the abstract should be at 0.3\u20130.5 times the number of pages. An abstract with\n10 lines for a paper of 10 pages looks way too excessive. 4See https://mathoverflow.net/questions/81128",

This helps neither the\nreaders to \ufb01nd anything at all, nor the authors of 2\u201319 to get credit; in fact, it pits them\nagainst each other by unfairly equalizing their research contributions. What you should\ndo is go over the papers individually, starting with the most important reference, and\ndescribe their contribution. Stop when you are tired. Here is an example of how this\nworks:\nOur Theorem 3 studies partitions into even primes. A strongly related re-\nsult in [A] studies partitions into into primes which are powers of two. This\npaper builds on the tools in [B], which studies partitions into primes which are\nsquares. In a di\ufb00erent direction, partitions into even Fermat primes have been\nstudied in [C,D], and more recently in [E], which under the GRH established\nWigner\u2019s semicircle law in this case. In an unusual development, last year [F]\nproved uncomputability of the partition function into odd perfect numbers,\nbut the paper remains under scrutiny (my colleague Kiran X. has been un-\nsuccessful in independently verifying the result). We should also mention a\nseries of papers [G1,G2,G3] on partitions into prime Catalan numbers, which\nsuccessively improves on the classical bound in [H] by using... As we mentioned earlier, this type of description should go into Final Remarks."

Well, it can be easy. But it can also be\npretty hard, especially if you are an inexperienced writer. The trouble with being clear\nas a concept, is that most people think it doesn\u2019t take time. They think one naturally\nbecomes a better writer. Quite the opposite is true. Making your paper clearer takes\ntime and a lot of e\ufb00ort.

And on the very last page you had to write h(h) which is just awful. What\nshould you do? Should you spend maybe 30 min going over every instance of h in the\npaper and renaming it accordingly?

This is particularly true about typesetting in LaTeX which\nis universal and represents its own advantages and challenges.

To make further contrast with older works, one no longer expects their papers to be\nall that interesting to survive decades. It\u2019s the short term goals that became all too\nimportant. Thus the emphasis should be on a modest goal of clear rather than perfect\nwriting. The same applies to reading.

If you can extract a little result which can be stated in the language that high\nschool or college students can understand and possibly solve by a direct argument, make\nit into an olympiad style problem. Send it to somebody on your national math olympiad\ncommittee (which comprise IMO), or the Putnam committee. They are always looking\nfor good and unusual problems, and many problems are in fact created this way. Third, if the problem you extract is too di\ufb03cult for the Putnam Competition, but\nyour argument in this case substantially simpli\ufb01es, write it up in a separate note. Try\nto make it accessible to undergraduates. Submit it to Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Intelligencer, Math. Magazine, or another journal targeting students and teachers.

We then work hard, trial-and-error, to eventually\n\ufb01gure out a solution. Sometimes we do this in a matter of hours and some-\ntimes it takes years, but we persevere.

        "HOW TO WRITE A CLEAR MATH PAPER\n17\nSecond, if at all possible, consider the simplest yet still nontrivial special case of your\nresult. If you can extract a little result which can be stated in the language that high\nschool or college students can understand and possibly solve by a direct argument, make\nit into an olympiad style problem. Send it to somebody on your national math olympiad\ncommittee (which comprise IMO), or the Putnam committee. They are always looking\nfor good and unusual problems, and many problems are in fact created this way. Third, if the problem you extract is too di\ufb03cult for the Putnam Competition, but\nyour argument in this case substantially simpli\ufb01es, write it up in a separate note. Try\nto make it accessible to undergraduates. Submit it to Amer. Math. Monthly, Math. Intelligencer, Math. Magazine, or another journal targeting students and teachers. If\nyou explain at the end how this special case \ufb01ts into your paper, this will clarify and\nbring more exposure to your work. 6.3. Rewrite and republish. Finally, suppose you already wrote and published the\npaper. You think it\u2019s being ignored because it\u2019s unclear. Well, rewrite it. Simplify\nall the arguments, maybe generalize the main result a bit, \ufb01nd some new examples or\napplications. And publish this new version, even if just on the arXiv. Rota advises to publish the same paper several times, and gives some famous exam-\nples [13]. While I disagree with this practice, I think there is a room for compromise. Say, for example, in your latest paper the argument is cumbersome because you are\novergeneralizing. It is then ok to start with a proof of a known theorem \u201cfor com-\npleteness\u201d and then explain how this proof needs to be modi\ufb01ed to work in greater\ngenerality. That way you get the best of both worlds: a clear presentation of your own\nold result and a clear pathway to your new generalization. Acknowledgements.

Sometimes you can still \ufb01nd some hanging sentences, sentences without a verb, etc.,\neven if you have no clue what is being said. 2I wrote in [11] how Sylvester\u2019s \u201c\ufb01sh-hook\u201d bijection was rediscovered in over a dozen papers.

        "Introduction. This is the hardest section to write. It\u2019s probably the only part of\nyour paper that will be read by all but a few most devoted readers. If you have a senior\ncoauthor, ask her or him to write this. If you don\u2019t, ask a senior colleague to read it\nand comment on your draft. Start writing your paper by writing the \ufb01rst draft of the\nIntroduction, so you have an idea what\u2019s in the paper, and completely rewrite it after\nthe rest of the paper is written. More often than not, the paper turns up di\ufb00erently\nthan you initially imagined it. This could be for technical reasons, or since you proved\nmore results, or now understand your own results much better than when you started\nwriting. Then let the paper stew for a week or two while you show it to your closest\nand trusted colleagues, and after their comments on the contents of the paper rewrite\nit again, perhaps with a new emphasis. To underscore the importance of the Introduction, here is a helpful quote by Rota [13],\nwho gets things half-right in my opinion:\n\u201cNowadays reading a mathematics paper from top to bottom is a rare event. If we wish our paper to be read, we had better provide our prospective readers\nwith strong motivation to do so. A lengthy introduction, summarizing the\nhistory of the subject, giving everybody his due, and perhaps enticingly out-\nlining the content of the paper in a discursive manner, will go some of the way\ntowards getting us a couple of readers.\u201d\nAs I explained earlier, the problem with this approach is that \u201cnowadays\u201d some people\ndon\u2019t even have patience to read a long introduction. So what should you do? Well,\nmake a lengthy introduction, Rota\u2013style, extract a few pages to keep in the introduction\nand the rest put into Final Remarks. Alternatively, use a Foreword. More on these\nlater. What to include into the introduction: Start by setting up the problem and statements\nof the main results. If there are only a few technical de\ufb01nitions needed for these"

We who have had mathematical training might be tempted to guess that a periodic sentence\nis one that repeats cyclically, but we would be wrong. Periodic sentences are those whose\ngrammatical and physical ends coincide: We must get adverbials out of the \ufb01nal position. For example, a verb that is intransitive must end the sentence.

        "\u00a7\uf731\uf732. Excerpts from class, October 23\n[notes by PMR]\nOne of the chief aspects of WEB is to encourage better programming, not just better expo-\nsition of programs. For example, many people say that about 25% of any piece of software\nshould be devoted to error handling and user guidance. But this will typically mean that\na subroutine might have 15 lines of \u2018what to do if the data is faulty\u2019 followed by one or\ntwo lines of \u2018what to do in the normal course of events\u2019. The subroutine then looks very\nmuch like an error-handling routine. This fails to motivate the writer to do a good job;\nhis heart just isn\u2019t in the error handling. WEB provides a solution to this. The procedure\ncan have a single line near the beginning that says \u27e8Check if the data is wrong 28 \u27e9and\npoints to another module. Thus the proper focus is maintained: In the main module we\nhave code devoted to handling the normal cases, and elsewhere we have all the error-case\ninstructions. The programmer never feels that he\u2019s writing a whole lot of stu\ufb00where he\u2019d\nreally much rather be writing something else; in module 28, it feels right to do the best\nerror detection and recovery. Don showed us an example of this from his undergraduate\nclass in which a routine had two references of the form\nif . .",
        "\u00a7\uf731\uf733. Excerpts from class, October 26\n[notes by PMR]\nWe moved on to the subject of user manuals. Don was disappointed that nobody had\nresponded to his request in a previous lecture to give him glaring examples of bad ones\u2014\neither they are being much better written these days or we hadn\u2019t taken him seriously. So\ninstead, Don produced mini-sized user manuals written by CS graduate students for his\nclass CS 304 earlier this year. The students had had to tackle \ufb01ve weird and wonderful\nproblems in ten weeks; one of the problems had been to design and implement some\nsoftware and to write a one-page user manual for the \u2018Digi\ufb02ash\u2019 display system. This is\nthe kind of thing you see in Times Square, and increasingly in bars and post o\ufb03ces, in\nwhich news and advertising \ufb02ows across a sort of dot-matrix screen. In this case, the\nscreen was to be a simple array of 8 by 256 pixels. The students had only two weeks in\nwhich to write the system and manual, which were then subject to the ultimate test, the\ntruly Na\u00a8\u0131ve User. The idea was that the user would need no understanding of computers\nor of writing, but should still be able to use the system to produce a variety of visual\ne\ufb00ects. The students divided themselves into four teams and so we saw four solutions to\nthe problem. A common failing was that terminology that seemed perfectly transparent meant nothing to\nDon\u2019s wife: \u201cMenu\u201d and \u201cScrolling\u201d for example. Such terms are so familiar to CS people,\nit never occurs to them that these are actually technical terms.",

Don struck back with the following:\nIt is good practice to use italics for the names of variables when they appear in\ncomments. Let the variables in the module title correspond to the local parameters in the\nmodule itself. According to this student\u2019s comments, his algorithm uses \u2018tail recursion\u2019. This is\nan impressive phrase, helpful in the proper context; but unfortunately that is not\nthe kind of recursion his program uses. However, Don did grant that his exposition was good, and said that it gave a nice intuition\nabout the functions of the modules. We saw a second program by the same student. It had the usual sprinkling of \u201cwicked\nwhiches\u201d\u2014\u2018which\u2019s that should have been \u2018that\u2019s. The purpose of the program was to\n\u201cenforce\u201d the triangle inequality on a table of data that speci\ufb01ed the distances between\npairs of large cities in the US. Don commented here that his project (from which these\nprograms came) intends to publish interesting data sets so that researchers in di\ufb00erent\nplaces can replicate each other\u2019s results. He also observed that a program running on a\ntable of \u201creal data,\u201d as here (the actual \u201co\ufb03cial\u201d distances between the cities in question)\nis a lot more interesting than the same program running on \u201crandom data.\u201d Returning to\nthe nitty-gritty of the program, Don observed that the student had made a good choice of\nvariable names\u2014for instance \u2018villains\u2019 for those parts of the data that were causing incon-\nsistencies. This \ufb01tted in nicely with the later exposition; he could talk about \u2018cut throats\u2019\nand so forth.

        "Any resemblance to the Metric System is purely\ncoincidental. It is an extremely natural and logical system, Don told us. For example,\nthe units of time were named after the editors of MAD (the new editors substituted their\nown names). He felt there was also a need for new units of counting, and so coined the\nMAD; 48 things constitute one MAD (or 49, a baker\u2019s MAD). Don didn\u2019t publish a better\nillustrated work until The TEXbook, he claimed, nor another paid one until he wrote for\nACM Computing Surveys some 12 years later. MAD forked over no less than $25 for this\nresearch paper, no mean sum thirty years ago. \u2018The Potrzebie System\u2019 still heads the list\nof publications on his C.V. MAD inexplicably declined Don\u2019s second article, \u201cRUNCIBLE: Algebraic Translation on\na Limited Computer,\u201d which was picked up by Communications of the ACM in 1959. Perhaps this was because it contained what even Don admits is probably one of the worst\n\u201cspaghetti\u201d \ufb02ow charts ever drawn. Not only does the chart attempt to illustrate the\nentire algorithm, but it contains an error (a misdirected arrow). The article included\na play-by-play account of the algorithm, which helped ameliorate the obscurity of the\nchart. Back in those days, Don now admits, he didn\u2019t know any better. Likewise, full of\nyouthful enthusiasm at being able to communicate improvements on a previously published\nalgorithm (Don was a Junior then), he failed to mention his co-authors in the paper; Don\ndid the writing but other students contributed illustrations and most of the ideas of the\nalgorithm. At the time he had no notion there was academic prestige to be gained through\npublication, Don confessed. This is, he said, a common mistake among young authors who\nfrequently overlook proper acknowledgments in their haste to get the news out. At the\nother extreme, he recalled, Paul Erd\u02ddos once cited a railroad car porter as a co-author.",
        "Some straightforward errors were easily corrected: A \u20181\u2019 had metamorphosed into an \u2018l\u2019\nand an \u2018\u2205\u2019 into a \u2018\u03d5\u2019. Typesetters who are unfamiliar with mathematics invariably \ufb01nd\ncreative things to do with this \u201cempty set\u201d symbol, Don said. Many problems show up\nonly at the page-proof stage. For example, one page began with the solitary last line of\na paragraph and then broke with a new subheading. Since the paragraph could just as\neasily introduce the new subsection as conclude the previous one, Don just moved the\nsubheading back one paragraph, putting it on the previous page. Don also got his \ufb02oor\nbrackets restored where square brackets appeared on the page proof. He didn\u2019t get his way on everything, though. Brackets were used interchangeably with\nparentheses in a mathematical formula, despite Don\u2019s protest that the former have special\nmeanings. Neither was Scienti\ufb01c American (\u2018SA\u2019, hereinafter) able to get hold of a photograph of\na particular Mesopotamian clay tablet that is housed in the Louvre. It is a table of\nreciprocals, and is probably the earliest example of a large database that was sorted into\norder for ease of retrieval. Don thinks this object de\ufb01nitely deserves a place in the hearts\nand minds of CS folk, being perhaps the \ufb01rst ever signi\ufb01cant piece of data processing. Even a modern computer might need a second or so to do the work involved. On the whole, Don was pretty happy with his article. It enjoys a continuing success\nas an SA reprint; thousands of copies are still sold to schools (with the page references\ncarefully renumbered). As far as Don knows, it\u2019s the only one of his articles to have been\ntranslated into Farsi (Persian). He showed us that in this language, as in others where\nthe text runs right to left across the page, mathematical formul\u00e6 are not reversed. The\nword \u2018hashing\u2019 invariably gives translators pause; it becomes 14 characters in Chinese, and\na French translator of one of his books once put in a call to the Acad\u00b4emie Fran\u00b8caise to",

Mary-Claire says that any of us with\naverages under 20 words per sentence are in the correct range for adult writing.

With 10 sentences we should be aiming for 9 or 10 di\ufb00erent lengths. The samples\nfrom our papers yielded 6 to 9 di\ufb00erent lengths. The di\ufb00erence between the word count\non the shortest sentence to the word count on the longest varied between 17 words to 37\nwords.

        "but the word makes for a witty exposition in arti\ufb01cial life; the English language has lots\nof vocabulary just waiting for such applications.)\nDon wondered aloud why it is that people talk about \u201cthe nth and mth positions\u201d (as this\nstudent had) thereby reversing the natural (or at any rate alphabetical) order? He also pointed to an issue that arises with the move from typewriters to computer\ntypesetting\u2014the fact that we now distinguish between opening and closing quotes. We\nsaw an example where the student had written \u201dmain program\u201d. To add to the confu-\nsion, di\ufb00erent languages have di\ufb00erent conventions for quotes; in German they appear like\nthis: \u201dThe Name of the Rose\u201c. How to represent this in a standard ASCII \ufb01le remains a\nmystery. Back to the triangle inequality. Don pointed out that one obvious check for bad data in\nthe distance table follows from the fact that the road distance can not be less than a Great\nCircle route. (\u201cIt could, if you had a tunnel\u201d commented a New Yorker in the audience.)\nThe student had written a nice group of modules based on this fact, and it illustrated the\nWEB facility of being able to put displayed equations into comments. \u201cSo WEB e\ufb00ectively just does macro substitution?\u201d asked another member of the class. Exactly, said Don. In fact the macros he uses are not very general\u2014they really allow only\none parameter. This means he doesn\u2019t need a complex parser, but in fact one can do a\ngreat deal within this restriction. For instance, it is not di\ufb03cult to simulate two-parameter\nmacros if we wish. Someone in the class commented that it seemed a little strange to put variable declarations\nin a di\ufb00erent module from their use. Don said that this was OK as long as they are close\nto their use, but large procedures should have their local variables \u201cdistributed\u201d as the\nexposition proceeds. Don recalled that older versions of Algol allowed you to declare a variable in the middle",

He was naturally\nmore eloquent, had a ready plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore\nme down more by his \ufb02uency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted\nwithout settling the point, and were not to see one another again for some time,\nI sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair and sent to him. He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of a side had passed, when\nmy father happened to \ufb01nd my papers and read them. Without entering into\nthe discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing;\nobserved that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling\nand pointing (which I ow\u2019d to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of\nexpression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several\ninstances. I saw the justice of his remarks, and thence grew more attentive to the\nmanner in writing, and determined to endeavor an improvement. About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third.",
        "I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, and was\nmuch delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible,\nto imitate it. With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints\nof the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without\nlooking at the book, try\u2019d to compleat the papers again, by expressing each\nhinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any\nsuitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with\nthe original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. But I found I\nwanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I\nthought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses;\nsince the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of di\ufb00erent length,\nto suit the measure, or of di\ufb00erent sound for rhyme, would have laid me under\na constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to \ufb01x that\nvariety in my mind, and make me master of it. Therefore I took some of the tales\nand turned them into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten\nthe prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections of\nhints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the\nbest order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts. By comparing my\nwork afterwards with the original, I discovered many faults and amended them;\nbut I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small\n[98\n\u00a7\uf733\uf739.

        "To illustrate the programs, Don had run them on a dozen or so sample texts. For instance,\nhe used a passage from the rather ponderous introduction to a book by Alonzo Church;\nsamples of PMR\u2019s and TLL\u2019s notes for CS 209; versions of his own exposition of binomial\ncoe\ufb03cients, vintage 1965 and 1985; Wuthering Heights; Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales; and part\nof a book about the Bible that Don is writing on weekends. The style routine produces\nfour di\ufb00erent readability grades for any piece of text. Each is literally a \u201cgrade\u201d in that\nit indicates what level of education the piece suggests. The basis of the grading is very\nstraightforward; it\u2019s a linear formula whose variables are the average number of syllables\n(or letters) per word and the average number of words per sentence (or sometimes the\nreciprocal of this value). For example, there are constants \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 such that\ngrade = \u03b1 (words/sentence) + \u03b2 (syllables/word) + \u03b3. How were \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 determined? The authors of each readability index simply look at\na large number of pieces of writing and assign them a grade-level \u2018by eye\u2019\u2014that is, they\nestimate the age of the intended reader. Each piece of text is then characterised by three\nreal numbers: the average number of words per sentence, the average number of syllables\nper word, and the subjective grade level. So each piece determines a single point in 3-space\n(plotted against three orthogonal axes); the set of pieces determines a scatter of points in\n3-space. Standard linear regression techniques are used to \ufb01nd the plane that is the \u201cbest\n\ufb01t\u201d for these points. The three parameters above de\ufb01ne this plane. Someone asked whether we should be shooting for some speci\ufb01c grade level, and if so, what\nlevel? Don replied that his usual aim is to minimise the level, although overdoing this will\ndefeat the purpose. In addition to the raw scores, a variety of other parameters come out of a style analysis:",
        "Don says that the chapter has an excellent blend of formal and informal discussion, with\nwell-chosen examples; this subject had never been \u201cpopularized\u201d before, so the task of\nwriting a good exposition was especially challenging. Don also praised the authors\u2019 typo-\ngraphic conventions (for example, logic is presented using a \u201ctypewriter\u201d font). Don said that we already have Mary-Claire\u2019s book, so he didn\u2019t have to introduce her to\nus. But he ran across some electronic mail she had written recently, and thought it was a\nparticularly elegant essay, so he passed it along (see \u00a7\uf732\uf736below). Computer scientists and\nmathematicians are way behind real writers when it comes to exquisite style. Finally, just in case we still craved more good examples to read, he handed out some\nexcerpts from a paper written by Garey, Graham, Johnson, and Knuth. Don says that\nhe included it because it has two proofs of di\ufb03cult theorems: proofs that are not, and\nprobably could not be, trivial. Don tried to interest his readers in the \ufb01rst proof (and algorithm) by presenting an example\nas a mathematical puzzle. He says that by solving the puzzle the reader can see that the\nproblem is not simplistic\u2014but that an algorithm might be possible. (\u201cThis builds exactly\nthe right mental structures in the reader\u2019s mind for this particular problem, I think. The\nalgorithm itself is the worst algorithm I have ever had to present\u2014but there is probably\nno simpler one.\u201d)\nWhile \ufb02ashing us part of the algorithm\u2014complete with more cases\nthan could \ufb01t on the monitor\u2014Don said, \u201cThe ability to handle lots of cases is Computer\nScience\u2019s strength and weakness. We are good at dealing with such complexity, but we\nsometimes don\u2019t try for unity when there is unity.\u201d\nThe second proof involves the reduction of one problem to another. The reduction requires\na very complicated system\u2014a system that Don found was well served by an extended\nbiological metaphor and some involved terminology.

        "The remaining 28 lectures covered these and other issues in depth. We saw many\nexamples of \u201cbefore\u201d and \u201cafter\u201d from manuscripts in progress. We learned how to avoid\nexcessive subscripts and superscripts. We discussed the documentation of algorithms, com-\nputer programs, and user manuals. We considered the process of refereeing and editing. We studied how to make e\ufb00ective diagrams and tables, and how to \ufb01nd appropriate quota-\ntions to spice up a text. Some of the material duplicated some of what would be discussed\nin writing classes o\ufb00ered by the English department, but the vast majority of the lectures\nwere devoted to issues that are speci\ufb01c to mathematics and/or computer science.

On occasion he has recruited his own referees when he found out that his target\npublication was supplying none. As an example, his paper on Literate Programming for\nthe British Computer Journal generated no referee reports (and no feedback of any kind);\nthey went right into print. Don repeatedly stated how invaluable he found \u201cfeedback from a motivated reader.\u201d He\nshowed us the comments that \u201cUrsula\u201d got on her paper, and they were pertinent in more\nthan one way. The referee found typographic errors and suggested notation changes, as\nwell as \ufb01nding errors where there were none present. The last set of comments were more\nimportant than they might at \ufb01rst seem because they pointed out where Don\u2019s presentation\nwas misleading or overly subtle.

None of these can be found here.\u201d A third said that the paper contained little that was\nnew, and supplied a substantial bibliography for the author to go away and study. The next\nreferee liked the algorithm and recommended the paper for publication. Don was surprised;\nhe had mistakenly thought that this referee had originally invented the algorithm himself! Another critic dismissed the paper as \u2018incredibly poorly written\u2019. Another commented it\nwas not a paper to be read, but rather a puzzle to be solved. Don told us that as a result of his experiment, the algorithm actually became quite well-\nknown.

        "When a hoity-toity\nword is used? The second vocabulary exercise, the writing of a thesaurus entry, is best done over a\nweek. After several days of slowly adding to our set of synonyms, we should compare\nour entry with an entry in our thesaurus. (Everyone needs at least one thesaurus and a\ngood unabridged dictionary.

Mary-Claire says even\nthough vocabulary improvement is more often considered than increasing our command\nof syntax, syntactic armory improvement is more important. She says that most of the\ntime we will use our basic three to four thousand words; we must use them in the most\ninteresting way possible. Speaking of using words in interesting ways, Mary-Claire has been reading the \ufb01rst draft\nof our term papers. There must be room for some improvement there: Her \ufb01rst comment\nwas, \u201cNobody sits down to write a boring paper.\u201d How can we tell when something we\nwrite is \u201csyntactically impoverished\u201d?

One syntactic trick not normally thought unusual was startlingly absent from our papers:\ntight parallels. The use of two adjacent sentences with exactly the same construction is\nan e\ufb00ective way to communicate similarity to our readers. Mary-Claire is curious how we\ncould all avoid this technique. Perhaps it is an artifact of the way that students of our\ngeneration were taught? Given this motivation to \u201cincrease our syntactic muscle,\u201d Mary-Claire led us back to\ndiscussing the \u201cSyntax\u201d exercises. She passed over the \ufb01rst two exercises as obvious, but\na few comments were made on \u201cperiodic\u201d sentences. We who have had mathematical training might be tempted to guess that a periodic sentence\nis one that repeats cyclically, but we would be wrong. Periodic sentences are those whose\ngrammatical and physical ends coincide: We must get adverbials out of the \ufb01nal position. For example, a verb that is intransitive must end the sentence. Period. Periodic sentences are not really appropriate in our kind of writing; they are a high literary\nform. Even though such a sentence form is more frequently encountered in church than in\nconference papers, the use of periodic sentences will heighten our awareness that we can\ncontrol sentence structure. The next exercise has us recast a sentence so as to change emphasis. What are the emphatic\npositions? The front of the sentence and the back. (\u201cThe middle of a sentence is sort of a\nslum.\u201d) But she says not to take her word for it; we should write sentences with varying\nemphasis and \ufb01nd out for ourselves. Mary-Claire says that the last syntactic exercise is \u201cincredibly wonderful\u201d: Write nonsense. Write a completely unrelated stream of thoughts with the correct glue: words like \u201cthus,\u201d\n\u201ctherefore,\u201d and \u201cas we can see.\u201d She says this is a fun exercise to do after a couple of\ndrinks.

For example, there are constants \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 such that\ngrade = \u03b1 (words/sentence) + \u03b2 (syllables/word) + \u03b3. How were \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 determined? The authors of each readability index simply look at\na large number of pieces of writing and assign them a grade-level \u2018by eye\u2019\u2014that is, they\nestimate the age of the intended reader. Each piece of text is then characterised by three\nreal numbers: the average number of words per sentence, the average number of syllables\nper word, and the subjective grade level. So each piece determines a single point in 3-space\n(plotted against three orthogonal axes); the set of pieces determines a scatter of points in\n3-space. Standard linear regression techniques are used to \ufb01nd the plane that is the \u201cbest\n\ufb01t\u201d for these points. The three parameters above de\ufb01ne this plane. Someone asked whether we should be shooting for some speci\ufb01c grade level, and if so, what\nlevel? Don replied that his usual aim is to minimise the level, although overdoing this will\ndefeat the purpose. In addition to the raw scores, a variety of other parameters come out of a style analysis:",

        "A. Poe (amended)\nDon, like Mary-Claire, scans the pages of The New Yorker for choice malapropisms to\nentertain us. In its columns the law \ufb01rm of Choate, Hall, & Stewart had been rendered\nas Choate, Hall, Ampersand, and Stewart, presumably by a journalist receiving dictation\nover the telephone. We also saw a splendid dangling participle from the same source:\n\u201cFlavor and texture of cooked okra are di\ufb00erent from other vegetables. We usually\ndon\u2019t eat it raw, but in judging at fairs, I frequently taste a slice of a pod to check\nmaturity and condition. In soups, it is used as a thickening agent. When fried, I\nlove okra.\u201d\n[When sober, can\u2019t stand the stu\ufb00. \u2014 The New Yorker]\nDon announced that he had good news and bad news for us. He gave us the good news\n\ufb01rst. Mary-Claire is to speak again on Wednesday. Also, Don \ufb01nally got up the courage\nto ask Paul Halmos to appear in our guest spot; he readily agreed and will speak next\nWednesday (9th December). This talk should be a \ufb01tting climax to the course. And a\nweek from today (Monday, 7th December) we will hear from Rosalie Stemer, a copy-editor\nfor The San Francisco Chronicle. Having thus softened us up with these cheerful tidings, Don delivered the Bad News: The\n\ufb01rst drafts of the term papers were, well . .",
        "but the word makes for a witty exposition in arti\ufb01cial life; the English language has lots\nof vocabulary just waiting for such applications.)\nDon wondered aloud why it is that people talk about \u201cthe nth and mth positions\u201d (as this\nstudent had) thereby reversing the natural (or at any rate alphabetical) order? He also pointed to an issue that arises with the move from typewriters to computer\ntypesetting\u2014the fact that we now distinguish between opening and closing quotes. We\nsaw an example where the student had written \u201dmain program\u201d. To add to the confu-\nsion, di\ufb00erent languages have di\ufb00erent conventions for quotes; in German they appear like\nthis: \u201dThe Name of the Rose\u201c. How to represent this in a standard ASCII \ufb01le remains a\nmystery. Back to the triangle inequality. Don pointed out that one obvious check for bad data in\nthe distance table follows from the fact that the road distance can not be less than a Great\nCircle route. (\u201cIt could, if you had a tunnel\u201d commented a New Yorker in the audience.)\nThe student had written a nice group of modules based on this fact, and it illustrated the\nWEB facility of being able to put displayed equations into comments. \u201cSo WEB e\ufb00ectively just does macro substitution?\u201d asked another member of the class. Exactly, said Don. In fact the macros he uses are not very general\u2014they really allow only\none parameter. This means he doesn\u2019t need a complex parser, but in fact one can do a\ngreat deal within this restriction. For instance, it is not di\ufb03cult to simulate two-parameter\nmacros if we wish. Someone in the class commented that it seemed a little strange to put variable declarations\nin a di\ufb00erent module from their use. Don said that this was OK as long as they are close\nto their use, but large procedures should have their local variables \u201cdistributed\u201d as the\nexposition proceeds. Don recalled that older versions of Algol allowed you to declare a variable in the middle",
        "There is no doubt that Fowler has had a signi\ufb01cant in\ufb02uence on the English language, but\nwhy is it that his e\ufb00ect on American English has been greater than on British English? To answer that question, we move our focus to New York in the year 1925: Harold Ross\nhas just founded the New Yorker magazine. Ross was a man who liked things to be clearly de\ufb01ned. He took Modern English Usage as\ngospel. For decades the New Yorker had reliably in\ufb02uential prose, and for decades H. W. Fowler\u2019s dictums were applied blindly to that prose. Mary-Claire was nearly nonplused as\nshe mentioned reading a collection of letters from a New Yorker editor to various literary\nluminaries. (\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but we had to change all your whiches to thats,\u201d sounds rather\npresumptuous when addressed to John Updike.) The New Yorker no longer treats Fowler\nas divinely inspired, and they haven\u2019t since the 1950s, but that leaves close to three decades\nof blind obedience to consider. According to Mary-Claire, Harold Ross\u2019s attachment to obedience is not unusual\u2014for\nAmericans.

For example, many people say that about 25% of any piece of software\nshould be devoted to error handling and user guidance. But this will typically mean that\na subroutine might have 15 lines of \u2018what to do if the data is faulty\u2019 followed by one or\ntwo lines of \u2018what to do in the normal course of events\u2019. The subroutine then looks very\nmuch like an error-handling routine. This fails to motivate the writer to do a good job;\nhis heart just isn\u2019t in the error handling. WEB provides a solution to this. The procedure\ncan have a single line near the beginning that says \u27e8Check if the data is wrong 28 \u27e9and\npoints to another module. Thus the proper focus is maintained: In the main module we\nhave code devoted to handling the normal cases, and elsewhere we have all the error-case\ninstructions. The programmer never feels that he\u2019s writing a whole lot of stu\ufb00where he\u2019d\nreally much rather be writing something else; in module 28, it feels right to do the best\nerror detection and recovery.

For example, there are constants \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 such that\ngrade = \u03b1 (words/sentence) + \u03b2 (syllables/word) + \u03b3. How were \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3 determined? The authors of each readability index simply look at\na large number of pieces of writing and assign them a grade-level \u2018by eye\u2019\u2014that is, they\nestimate the age of the intended reader. Each piece of text is then characterised by three\nreal numbers: the average number of words per sentence, the average number of syllables\nper word, and the subjective grade level. So each piece determines a single point in 3-space\n(plotted against three orthogonal axes); the set of pieces determines a scatter of points in\n3-space. Standard linear regression techniques are used to \ufb01nd the plane that is the \u201cbest\n\ufb01t\u201d for these points. The three parameters above de\ufb01ne this plane. Someone asked whether we should be shooting for some speci\ufb01c grade level, and if so, what\nlevel? Don replied that his usual aim is to minimise the level, although overdoing this will\ndefeat the purpose. In addition to the raw scores, a variety of other parameters come out of a style analysis:",

A paper submitted to an academic journal\nis usually passed to one or more referees by the editor of the journal. Each referee is\nintended to be an expert in the relevant \ufb01eld, and thus in a position to tell the editor\nwhether or not the paper merits publication. Don pointed out that many of us will one\nday \ufb01nd our papers being subject to just this scrutiny; and some of us will certainly be\nasked to assess other people\u2019s papers ourselves. Don talked about his now-famous research on \u201cThe Toilet Paper Problem.\u201d This was \ufb01rst\npublished in the Monthly, and as Don pointed out to the Editor in his cover letter, many\nof its readers probably keep their copies in the bathroom anyway. The editor (Halmos)\nreplied a little gravely that \u201cjokes are dangerous in our journal,\u201d and asked Don to think\ntwice about the scatological references. Don did agree to change the section names\u2014which\noriginally continued the pun with such headings as \u2018An absorbing barrier\u2019, \u2018A process\nof elimination\u2019, and \u2018Residues\u2019\u2014to innocuous equivalents, but kept the title intact. In\njusti\ufb01cation of this, Don pointed out to the editor that two talks had already been given on\nhis results under this title, and that the material had been widely circulated and discussed. \u201cYour toilet paper is accepted,\u201d replied Halmos. Don confessed that he still has occasional\ndoubts when he catches sight of the title amongst his papers, but the deed is done now."

Today we begin to discuss topics speci\ufb01c to\nthe writing of Computer Science. We are not abandoning mathematical concerns; Don says that a technical typist in Com-\nputer Science must know all that a Math department typist must know plus quite a bit\nmore. He showed us two examples where mathematical journals had trouble presenting\nprograms, algorithms, or concrete mathematics in papers he wrote.

        "\u00a7\uf736. Excerpts from class, October 12\n[notes by TLL]\nDon opened class by saying that up until now he has been criticizing our writing; now he\nwill show us what he does to his own. Perhaps apropos showing us his own writing he\nquoted Dijkstra: \u201cA good teacher will teach his students the importance of style and how\nto develop their own style\u2014not how to mimic his.\u201d\nFirst he showed us a letter from Bob Floyd. The letter opened by saying \u2018Don, Please stop\nusing so many exclamation points!\u2019 and closed with at least \ufb01ve exclamation points. After\nreceiving this letter he looked in The Art of Computer Programming and found about two\nexclamation points per page. (Among the other biographical tidbits we learned at this\nclass were that Don went to secretarial school, types 80 words per minute, and once knew\ntwo kinds of shorthand.)\nDon is writing a book with Oren Patashnik and Ron Graham. The book is entitled\nConcrete Mathematics and is to be used for CS 260. He showed us two copies of Chapter\nFive of this book: one copy he called \u201cBefore\u201d and one he called \u201cAfter\u201d. The Before copy actually came into existence long after the work on the book began. Oren\nwrote several drafts using the LATEX book style, and then the authors availed themselves\nof the services of a book designer. The designer decided how wide the text was, what\nfonts were to be used, what chapter headings looked like, and a host of other things. The\ndesigner, at the authors\u2019 request, has left room in the inner margins for \u201cgra\ufb03ti.\u201d That\nis, for informal snappy comments from the peanut gallery. (This idea was \u201cstolen\u201d from\nthe booklet Approaching Stanford.)\nThe After copy is just another formally typeset revision of the Before copy. Neither copy\nhas yet been through a professional copy editor. Having now mentioned copy editors and\nbook designers, Don said, \u201cIn these days of author self-publishing, we must not forget the\nvalue of professionals.\u201d (Actually, the copy editor was \ufb01rst mentioned when an error in",
        "of course had to tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they \u201ccorrect\u201d it). Don outlined three basic algorithms: \ufb01rst \ufb01t (which essentially packs the text as tightly as\npossible one line at a time); best \ufb01t (which can loosen it up if this works better, but still\nworks line by line); and optimum \ufb01t (optimal in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the\n\u201cdemerits\u201d earned by the various distortions of each line, taken over the paragraph as a\nwhole). To describe this last algorithm, Don drew a diagram. It is essentially a graph, each\nnode on level p corresponding to a di\ufb00erent word after which the pth line might be broken. Edges run between nodes on successive levels, and are labeled by the demerits scored by\nthe line of text they de\ufb01ne. The problem of \ufb01nding an optimal \ufb01t thus reduces to \ufb01nding\na least-cost path from the top to the bottom node; well-understood search techniques can\nbe used for this. Don commented that certain \u201cdemerit-cuto\ufb00s\u201d will limit the number of\nnodes on each level and thus speed the algorithm. This means that a solution in which\none very distorted line permits all the rest to be displayed perfectly might be missed. If the above account is opaque, it only goes to show why diagrams can be so useful. The article includes histograms to illustrate how frequently TEX generates more-or-less\ndistorted lines of text. As he explained, this was biased by the fact that he would usually\nre-write any particularly ugly paragraph. A second histogram con\ufb01rmed that the text was\nconsiderably more distorted when it hadn\u2019t been hand-crafted to the line width that TEX\nwas generating, yet the new algorithm was signi\ufb01cantly better than Brands X and Y . Finally, we saw an old Bible whose printers were so keen to \ufb01ll out the page width that\nthey inserted strings of o\u2019s to \ufb01ll up any gaps.",
        "Try to supply constructive criticism, Don urged. These human issues are not discussed in\nForscher\u2019s \u2018Rules\u2019. In addition, the referee can contribute to the technical quality of a paper by giving ref-\nerences to related work of which the author was apparently unaware, or improving the\nresults. Don himself has contributed results anonymously to papers\u2014more than one au-\nthor has had to add a footnote: \u201cMy thanks to the referee for Theorems 4, 5, and 6.\u201d\nDon was always pleased to feel that by doing this the image of the journal was improved. A journal should be seen as a source of wisdom, so let us be cooperative toward this end,\nnot legalistic. How should one choose a journal to which to submit a paper? Don thought the answer is\nto look for the one with the best referees, not the one with the least critical editor. After\nall, an author presumably wants to know whether he has really made a contribution to his\n\ufb01eld. So \ufb01nd a journal that has handled papers on related subjects. Someone asked whether the letters that appear in journals are also refereed. Don said\nthat sometimes they are, sometimes not. There is often nothing to distinguish letters from\nshort papers. Some journals do not use referees at all. Their readership must be willing to wade through\na great deal of nonsense. The ACM did at one time have plans to publish an unrefereed\njournal, but to Don\u2019s relief those plans never came to fruition. At this point Don confessed to a sneaky trick he had pulled way back in the 60s. At that\ntime he had just begun to edit the programming languages material for the Communica-\ntions of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM. He had no way of knowing which of his\nreferees were any good, so in an e\ufb00ort to calibrate them he sent all a copy of the same paper\nand solicited their opinions. Don had already refereed the paper himself, of course, and\nfound it a very badly written exposition of a very interesting algorithm (due to someone",

The solution we were looking at did have a one-line\ndescription of how to EXIT, but Don said even this is jargon. The second solution was Digi\ufb02ashTM. It had a good introductory and motivational para-\ngraph, albeit with a whole crowd of \u2018which\u2019s that should have been \u2018that\u2019s. Unfortunately\nit claimed that the system was very easy to use and understand\u2014a claim that can rebound\nby making the user feel stupid. There was a major \ufb02aw in the program in that one was ex-\npected to hit OPTION-B to enter \u2018bold\u2019 mode, and then OPTION-B again to leave it. Don\nthought it would be far more natural to type OPTION-N (for \u2018normal\u2019) instead. Option-V\nwas \u201creverse video\u201d\u2014another jargon word, and why wasn\u2019t this OPTION-R? There were\nsome cute options though: \u2018M\u2019 for \u2018slowly materializing\u2019 text, and an assortment of small\nanimal logos that could be made to appear. The third solution was the DiJKSTra system, so named to keep it su\ufb03ciently Dutch\n(obscure in-joke, please ignore). The authors had a nice use of the phrase \u2018\ufb02ashing bar\u2019\ninstead of the more technical \u2018cursor\u2019 (though for some reason they still felt impelled to\nde\ufb01ne the latter as the former), and likewise they said \u2018hit return\u2019 instead of \u2018enter\u2019 (or\nworse, ENTER). They also kept their sentences nice and short. Another good idea was\nthat the manual invited the user to type \u2018?\u2019 to get an online demonstration, thus sparing\nus a painful description of such arcane concepts as boldface italic reverse video fade-in",
        "Don went through the solutions in ascending order of competence. The class reaction to\nthis discussion might almost have led one to believe that some of the authors were sitting\namongst us. Don digressed on the subject of \u2018i.e.\u2019. Is it formal, he asked, or is it part of the language? He confessed that he was considering taking all the \u2018i.e.\u2019s out of his new book. One thing\nhe does know: You should always put a comma after \u2018i.e.\u2019.

For example, many people say that about 25% of any piece of software\nshould be devoted to error handling and user guidance. But this will typically mean that\na subroutine might have 15 lines of \u2018what to do if the data is faulty\u2019 followed by one or\ntwo lines of \u2018what to do in the normal course of events\u2019. The subroutine then looks very\nmuch like an error-handling routine. This fails to motivate the writer to do a good job;\nhis heart just isn\u2019t in the error handling. WEB provides a solution to this. The procedure\ncan have a single line near the beginning that says \u27e8Check if the data is wrong 28 \u27e9and\npoints to another module. Thus the proper focus is maintained: In the main module we\nhave code devoted to handling the normal cases, and elsewhere we have all the error-case\ninstructions. The programmer never feels that he\u2019s writing a whole lot of stu\ufb00where he\u2019d\nreally much rather be writing something else; in module 28, it feels right to do the best\nerror detection and recovery.

Typesetters who are unfamiliar with mathematics invariably \ufb01nd\ncreative things to do with this \u201cempty set\u201d symbol, Don said. Many problems show up\nonly at the page-proof stage. For example, one page began with the solitary last line of\na paragraph and then broke with a new subheading. Since the paragraph could just as\neasily introduce the new subsection as conclude the previous one, Don just moved the\nsubheading back one paragraph, putting it on the previous page. Don also got his \ufb02oor\nbrackets restored where square brackets appeared on the page proof. He didn\u2019t get his way on everything, though.

It enjoys a continuing success\nas an SA reprint; thousands of copies are still sold to schools (with the page references\ncarefully renumbered). As far as Don knows, it\u2019s the only one of his articles to have been\ntranslated into Farsi (Persian). He showed us that in this language, as in others where\nthe text runs right to left across the page, mathematical formul\u00e6 are not reversed. The\nword \u2018hashing\u2019 invariably gives translators pause; it becomes 14 characters in Chinese, and\na French translator of one of his books once put in a call to the Acad\u00b4emie Fran\u00b8caise to",
        "Try to supply constructive criticism, Don urged. These human issues are not discussed in\nForscher\u2019s \u2018Rules\u2019. In addition, the referee can contribute to the technical quality of a paper by giving ref-\nerences to related work of which the author was apparently unaware, or improving the\nresults. Don himself has contributed results anonymously to papers\u2014more than one au-\nthor has had to add a footnote: \u201cMy thanks to the referee for Theorems 4, 5, and 6.\u201d\nDon was always pleased to feel that by doing this the image of the journal was improved. A journal should be seen as a source of wisdom, so let us be cooperative toward this end,\nnot legalistic. How should one choose a journal to which to submit a paper? Don thought the answer is\nto look for the one with the best referees, not the one with the least critical editor. After\nall, an author presumably wants to know whether he has really made a contribution to his\n\ufb01eld. So \ufb01nd a journal that has handled papers on related subjects. Someone asked whether the letters that appear in journals are also refereed. Don said\nthat sometimes they are, sometimes not. There is often nothing to distinguish letters from\nshort papers. Some journals do not use referees at all. Their readership must be willing to wade through\na great deal of nonsense. The ACM did at one time have plans to publish an unrefereed\njournal, but to Don\u2019s relief those plans never came to fruition. At this point Don confessed to a sneaky trick he had pulled way back in the 60s. At that\ntime he had just begun to edit the programming languages material for the Communica-\ntions of the ACM and the Journal of the ACM. He had no way of knowing which of his\nreferees were any good, so in an e\ufb00ort to calibrate them he sent all a copy of the same paper\nand solicited their opinions. Don had already refereed the paper himself, of course, and\nfound it a very badly written exposition of a very interesting algorithm (due to someone",
        "solution to this problem in English is \u2018he\u2019. The traditional solution is \u2018they\u2019.\u201d\nMany people in the audience stated pieces of opinions, but time was nearly up. \u201cTo each\ntheir own.\u201d Paul moved to the next topic: Proof by contradiction. He emphasized that\nproofs by contradiction should not be used if a direct proof is available. For example,\nhe noted that proofs of linear independence often say, \u201cSuppose the variables are linearly\ndependent. Then there are coe\ufb03cients, not all zero, such that . . . contradicting the as-\nsumption that the coe\ufb03cients are nonzero.\u201d This circuitous route can usually be replaced\nby a direct argument: \u201cIf the linear relation . .",
        "but the word makes for a witty exposition in arti\ufb01cial life; the English language has lots\nof vocabulary just waiting for such applications.)\nDon wondered aloud why it is that people talk about \u201cthe nth and mth positions\u201d (as this\nstudent had) thereby reversing the natural (or at any rate alphabetical) order? He also pointed to an issue that arises with the move from typewriters to computer\ntypesetting\u2014the fact that we now distinguish between opening and closing quotes. We\nsaw an example where the student had written \u201dmain program\u201d. To add to the confu-\nsion, di\ufb00erent languages have di\ufb00erent conventions for quotes; in German they appear like\nthis: \u201dThe Name of the Rose\u201c. How to represent this in a standard ASCII \ufb01le remains a\nmystery. Back to the triangle inequality. Don pointed out that one obvious check for bad data in\nthe distance table follows from the fact that the road distance can not be less than a Great\nCircle route. (\u201cIt could, if you had a tunnel\u201d commented a New Yorker in the audience.)\nThe student had written a nice group of modules based on this fact, and it illustrated the\nWEB facility of being able to put displayed equations into comments. \u201cSo WEB e\ufb00ectively just does macro substitution?\u201d asked another member of the class. Exactly, said Don. In fact the macros he uses are not very general\u2014they really allow only\none parameter. This means he doesn\u2019t need a complex parser, but in fact one can do a\ngreat deal within this restriction. For instance, it is not di\ufb03cult to simulate two-parameter\nmacros if we wish. Someone in the class commented that it seemed a little strange to put variable declarations\nin a di\ufb00erent module from their use. Don said that this was OK as long as they are close\nto their use, but large procedures should have their local variables \u201cdistributed\u201d as the\nexposition proceeds. Don recalled that older versions of Algol allowed you to declare a variable in the middle",
        "actually quite easy to do in WEB, a claim that was greeted with a certain skeptical laughter\nfrom the class (all doubtless recalling hours spent wasted trying to get tables just right). Referring again to his \u2018optimal prepaging\u2019 paper (which included a diagram in which two\napproximately diagonal lines crawled across the page, touching occasionally to indicate a\npage fault) Don told us that the referee had complained that the \ufb01gure was too detailed. Don disagreed with this, saying that the detail was there for those who want to see it, but\ncould easily be ignored by those who don\u2019t. Don confessed that he always has been very\nconcerned with the minuti\u00e6 of his subject, and seldom thought any detail too tri\ufb02ing to\nbother with. Don discussed a paper he had written with Michael Plass on TEX\u2019s algorithm for placing\nline-breaks in a paragraph [Software\u2014Practice & Experience 11 (1981), 1119\u20131184]. The\nmain di\ufb03culty in writing the paper was: How to describe the problem and the new al-\ngorithm? First of all, they chose a paragraph from one of Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales as \u201ctest\ndata\u201d with which to illustrate the process. As Don remarked once before, it is better to\nuse \u201creal\u201d data than \u201csample data\u201d that have in fact been cooked up solely to use as an\nexample. [Grimms\u2019 Fairy Tales, along with the text of Harold and Maude, are kept online\non SAIL, an ancient and eccentric CSD computer.] Corresponding to each line of any right-\nand-left-justi\ufb01ed paragraph is a real number, positive or negative, indicating the degree to\nwhich the line had to be stretched or compressed to \ufb01t the space exactly. In his paper,\nDon prints these numbers in a column beside his typeset paragraph. Don used a couple of\nlines of the paper itself to show how bad it looks if these adjustments are too extreme (and\nof course had to tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they \u201ccorrect\u201d it). Don outlined three basic algorithms: \ufb01rst \ufb01t (which essentially packs the text as tightly as",
        "\u00a7\uf731\uf735. Excerpts from class, October 30\n[notes by PMR]\nToday Don spoke about the refereeing process. A paper submitted to an academic journal\nis usually passed to one or more referees by the editor of the journal. Each referee is\nintended to be an expert in the relevant \ufb01eld, and thus in a position to tell the editor\nwhether or not the paper merits publication. Don pointed out that many of us will one\nday \ufb01nd our papers being subject to just this scrutiny; and some of us will certainly be\nasked to assess other people\u2019s papers ourselves. Don talked about his now-famous research on \u201cThe Toilet Paper Problem.\u201d This was \ufb01rst\npublished in the Monthly, and as Don pointed out to the Editor in his cover letter, many\nof its readers probably keep their copies in the bathroom anyway. The editor (Halmos)\nreplied a little gravely that \u201cjokes are dangerous in our journal,\u201d and asked Don to think\ntwice about the scatological references. Don did agree to change the section names\u2014which\noriginally continued the pun with such headings as \u2018An absorbing barrier\u2019, \u2018A process\nof elimination\u2019, and \u2018Residues\u2019\u2014to innocuous equivalents, but kept the title intact. In\njusti\ufb01cation of this, Don pointed out to the editor that two talks had already been given on\nhis results under this title, and that the material had been widely circulated and discussed. \u201cYour toilet paper is accepted,\u201d replied Halmos. Don confessed that he still has occasional\ndoubts when he catches sight of the title amongst his papers, but the deed is done now.",
        "He could\nhave used a speci\ufb01c programming language, but he was afraid that such a choice would\nalienate people (either because they hated the language or because they had no access to\nthe language). So he decided to write his algorithms in English. His Algorithms are presented rather like Theorems with labeled steps; often they have\naccompanying (but very high-level) \ufb02ow charts (a technique he \ufb01rst saw in Russian liter-\nature of the 1950s). The numbered steps have parenthetical remarks that we would call\ncomments; after 1968 these parenthetical remarks are often invariant relations that can be\nused in a formal proof of program correctness. Don has received many letters complimenting him on his approach, but he says it is not\nreally successful. Explaining why, he said, \u201cPeople keep saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to present an\nalgorithm in Knuth\u2019s style,\u2019 and then they completely botch it by ignoring the conventions\nI think are most important. This style must just be a personal style that works for me. So get a personal style that works for you.\u201d In recent papers he has used the pidgin Algol\nstyle introduced by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman; but he will not change his style for the\nyet-un\ufb01nished volumes of The Art of Computer Programming because he wants to keep\nthe entire series consistent. Don says that a computer program is a piece of literature. (\u201cI look forward to the day\nwhen a Pulitzer Prize will be given for the best computer program of the year.\u201d)\nHe\nsays that, apart from the bene\ufb01t to be gained for the readers of our programs, he \ufb01nds\nthat treating programs in this manner actually helps to make them run smoothly on the\ncomputer. (\u201cBecause you get it right when you have to think about it that way.\u201d)\nHe gave us a reprint of \u201cProgramming Pearls\u201d by Jon Bentley, from Communications of\nthe ACM 29 (May 1986), pages 364\u2013369, and told us we had best read it by Wednesday\nsince it will be an important topic of discussion.

        "One commentator simply went through line by line, listing\nhis complaints point by point.

None of these can be found here.\u201d A third said that the paper contained little that was\nnew, and supplied a substantial bibliography for the author to go away and study. The next\nreferee liked the algorithm and recommended the paper for publication. Don was surprised;\nhe had mistakenly thought that this referee had originally invented the algorithm himself! Another critic dismissed the paper as \u2018incredibly poorly written\u2019. Another commented it\nwas not a paper to be read, but rather a puzzle to be solved. Don told us that as a result of his experiment, the algorithm actually became quite well-\nknown. On one occasion Don ripped into a paper with a long report on its failings, and was later\ntold by the author that those constructive comments had changed his life: The author had\nresolved that from then on he was going to study writing and give a lot of attention to\nexposition. This nameless individual went on to become a renowned professor at a great\n(but here equally nameless) university, and an editor of a \ufb01ne journal. In answer to a question, Don said that if the content of a paper was obviously bad, he\nwould not spend time reviewing the grammar. But in studying a paper that really has\nsomething to say, then he would also try to ensure that it was said as well as possible. Don showed us some referees\u2019 reports on one of his recent papers. The editor had told him\nthat these were \u2018mostly positive\u2019\u2014in fact two were in favour and one against. The referees\nin this case had been asked to answer a speci\ufb01c list of questions about his paper\u2014Don\nsaid that this tedious format might at least cause a referee to consider issues he might",
        "Next came a tricky question of tenses. \u201cGabow and Tarjan[Gab83] show that for many\nalgorithms that had such a multiplicative factor in their worst-case complexities, the mul-\ntiplicative term can be removed.\u201d Here \u2018had\u2019 should be \u2018have\u2019; an algorithm lives forever,\nand its worst-case complexity is a timeless fact about it. However, the problem solved\nby an algorithm can have di\ufb00erent known complexities at di\ufb00erent times; therefore \u2018had\u2019\nwould be okay if \u2018algorithms\u2019 were \u2018problems\u2019. (The quoted sentence also exhibits other\nanomalies. A \u2018multiplicative factor\u2019 is not also a \u2018multiplicative term\u2019; factors are multi-\nplied, terms are added. Also the logic of the sentence can be unwound to make the point\nclearer: \u201cGabow and Tarjan have shown how to improve the algorithms by removing such\na multiplicative factor from the worst-case complexities in many cases [Gab83].\u201d)\nWe talked about abbreviations for bibliographic references. Don didn\u2019t like the lack of\nspace before the bracket in \u201c. .",
        "Don says that the chapter has an excellent blend of formal and informal discussion, with\nwell-chosen examples; this subject had never been \u201cpopularized\u201d before, so the task of\nwriting a good exposition was especially challenging. Don also praised the authors\u2019 typo-\ngraphic conventions (for example, logic is presented using a \u201ctypewriter\u201d font). Don said that we already have Mary-Claire\u2019s book, so he didn\u2019t have to introduce her to\nus. But he ran across some electronic mail she had written recently, and thought it was a\nparticularly elegant essay, so he passed it along (see \u00a7\uf732\uf736below). Computer scientists and\nmathematicians are way behind real writers when it comes to exquisite style. Finally, just in case we still craved more good examples to read, he handed out some\nexcerpts from a paper written by Garey, Graham, Johnson, and Knuth. Don says that\nhe included it because it has two proofs of di\ufb03cult theorems: proofs that are not, and\nprobably could not be, trivial. Don tried to interest his readers in the \ufb01rst proof (and algorithm) by presenting an example\nas a mathematical puzzle. He says that by solving the puzzle the reader can see that the\nproblem is not simplistic\u2014but that an algorithm might be possible. (\u201cThis builds exactly\nthe right mental structures in the reader\u2019s mind for this particular problem, I think. The\nalgorithm itself is the worst algorithm I have ever had to present\u2014but there is probably\nno simpler one.\u201d)\nWhile \ufb02ashing us part of the algorithm\u2014complete with more cases\nthan could \ufb01t on the monitor\u2014Don said, \u201cThe ability to handle lots of cases is Computer\nScience\u2019s strength and weakness. We are good at dealing with such complexity, but we\nsometimes don\u2019t try for unity when there is unity.\u201d\nThe second proof involves the reduction of one problem to another. The reduction requires\na very complicated system\u2014a system that Don found was well served by an extended\nbiological metaphor and some involved terminology. As his metaphor, he chose the jelly\ufb01sh",
        "Don, obviously a fan of rewriting in general, told us that he knows of many computer\nprograms that were improved by scrapping everything after six months and starting from\nscratch. He said that this exact approach was used at Burroughs on their Algol compiler\nin 1960 and the result was what Don considers to be one of the best computer programs\nhe has ever seen. On the limits of the usefulness of rewriting, he did say, \u201cAny writing can\nbe improved. But eventually you have to put something out the door.\u201d\nThe last part of class was spent discussing the font used in the coming book: Euler. The Euler typeface was designed by Hermann Zapf (\u201cprobably the greatest living type\ndesigner\u201d) and is an especially appropriate font to use in a book that is all about Euler\u2019s\nwork. The idea of the face is to look a bit handwritten. For example, the zero to be used\nfor mathematics has a point at the apex because \u201cwhen people write zeros, they never\nreally close them.\u201d This zero is di\ufb00erent from the zero used in the text (for example, in a\ndate), so book preparation with Euler needs more care than usual. You have to distinguish\nmathematical numerals from English-language numerals in the manuscript. Somebody asked about \u2018all\u2019 versus \u2018all of\u2019. Which should it be? Answer: That\u2019s a very\ngood question. Sometimes one way sounds best, sometimes the other. You have to use\nyour ear. Another tricky business is the position of \u2018only\u2019 and \u2018also\u2019; Don says he keeps\nshifting those words around when he edits for \ufb02ow. \u00a7\uf737. Excerpts from class, October 14\n[notes by PMR]\nDon discussed the labours of the book designer and showed us specimen \u201cpage plans\u201d and\nexample pages. The former are templates for the page and show the exact dimensions of\nmargins, paragraphs, etc. His designer also suggested a novel scheme for equations: They\nare to be indented much like paragraphs rather than being centered in the traditional\nway. We also saw conventions for the display of algorithms and tables. Although Don",

One syntactic trick not normally thought unusual was startlingly absent from our papers:\ntight parallels. The use of two adjacent sentences with exactly the same construction is\nan e\ufb00ective way to communicate similarity to our readers. Mary-Claire is curious how we\ncould all avoid this technique. Perhaps it is an artifact of the way that students of our\ngeneration were taught? Given this motivation to \u201cincrease our syntactic muscle,\u201d Mary-Claire led us back to\ndiscussing the \u201cSyntax\u201d exercises. She passed over the \ufb01rst two exercises as obvious, but\na few comments were made on \u201cperiodic\u201d sentences. We who have had mathematical training might be tempted to guess that a periodic sentence\nis one that repeats cyclically, but we would be wrong. Periodic sentences are those whose\ngrammatical and physical ends coincide: We must get adverbials out of the \ufb01nal position. For example, a verb that is intransitive must end the sentence. Period. Periodic sentences are not really appropriate in our kind of writing; they are a high literary\nform. Even though such a sentence form is more frequently encountered in church than in\nconference papers, the use of periodic sentences will heighten our awareness that we can\ncontrol sentence structure. The next exercise has us recast a sentence so as to change emphasis. What are the emphatic\npositions? The front of the sentence and the back. (\u201cThe middle of a sentence is sort of a\nslum.\u201d) But she says not to take her word for it; we should write sentences with varying\nemphasis and \ufb01nd out for ourselves. Mary-Claire says that the last syntactic exercise is \u201cincredibly wonderful\u201d: Write nonsense. Write a completely unrelated stream of thoughts with the correct glue: words like \u201cthus,\u201d\n\u201ctherefore,\u201d and \u201cas we can see.\u201d She says this is a fun exercise to do after a couple of\ndrinks.

Don says that the solutions were surprisingly good (see \u00a7\uf732\uf731). One of the proofs described in that section contains illustrations in four colors. Don says\nthat color can be used e\ufb00ectively in talks, but usually not in papers (for that matter,\nLeslie Lamport says that proofs should never be presented in talks, but only in papers). Technical illustrations, even without four colors, cause no end of trouble: Don says that\nthe amount of work involved in preparing a paper for publication is proportional to the\ncube of the number of illustrations. But they are indispensable in many cases. Don showed us several of the illustrations, charts, and tables from The Art of Computer\nProgramming, Volume 3, and recounted the di\ufb03culties in choosing clear methods of pre-\nsenting his ideas. He also mentioned some technical and artistic problems that he had with\nan illustration: At what angle should the truncated octahedron on page 13 be displayed? His books contain some numerical tables (\u201cwhich are sometimes thought to be unenlight-\nening\u201d); Don says that they can sometimes present ideas that can\u2019t be demonstrated\ngraphically (such as numbers oscillating about 2 with period 2\u03c0, page 41). Diagrams with\naccompanying text are also used. Don made sure that the \ufb01nal text was arranged opposite\nthe diagrams to which it refers. The book contains a running example of how 16 particular numbers are sorted by dozens\nof di\ufb00erent algorithms. Each algorithm leads to a di\ufb00erent graphical presentation of the\nsorting activities on those numbers (pages 77, 82, 84, 97, 98, 106, 110, 113, 115, 124, 140,\n143, 147, 151, 161, 165, 166, 172, 175, 205, 251, 253, 254, 359). \u00a7\uf732\uf730.

        "Don disagreed with our guest speaker, Herb Wilf, who had said that he would tolerate\nmore stylistic lapses in the Journal of Algorithms than in the Monthly. Authors, thought\nDon, should always be encouraged to do better; he could recall only a single occasion when,\nas a referee or editor, he could recommend no improvements at all. (The author in this\ncase was George Collins writing for the ACM journal.) Let us publish journals to be proud\nof, he said. This was sadly not true of Computer Science in the early 60s. Some published\nresults were just plain wrong; or a correct result was incorrectly proved; or a paper simply\ncontained no results at all! Contrast this state of a\ufb00airs, said Don, to the math journals\nthat were published in the 20s and 30s\u2014lea\ufb01ng through them at random we see a host\nof familiar names and theorems, because so much of what was written then was polished,\nsigni\ufb01cant, and worth reprinting in textbooks. The same could not be said of today\u2019s\ne\ufb00orts\u2014perhaps we have grown increasingly tolerant of substandard work. Referees should try to be teachers, said Don. The author you criticize today will be writing\nanother paper tomorrow, so try to help him improve his writing. Unfortunately, referees\nwill often be over-critical and make quite tasteless comments on papers, knowing that\nthey do so under a cloak of anonymity. This only angers the author and he learns nothing.",

The ACM did at one time have plans to publish an unrefereed\njournal, but to Don\u2019s relief those plans never came to fruition.

He had no way of knowing which of his\nreferees were any good, so in an e\ufb00ort to calibrate them he sent all a copy of the same paper\nand solicited their opinions. Don had already refereed the paper himself, of course, and\nfound it a very badly written exposition of a very interesting algorithm (due to someone",
        "He could\nhave used a speci\ufb01c programming language, but he was afraid that such a choice would\nalienate people (either because they hated the language or because they had no access to\nthe language). So he decided to write his algorithms in English. His Algorithms are presented rather like Theorems with labeled steps; often they have\naccompanying (but very high-level) \ufb02ow charts (a technique he \ufb01rst saw in Russian liter-\nature of the 1950s). The numbered steps have parenthetical remarks that we would call\ncomments; after 1968 these parenthetical remarks are often invariant relations that can be\nused in a formal proof of program correctness. Don has received many letters complimenting him on his approach, but he says it is not\nreally successful. Explaining why, he said, \u201cPeople keep saying, \u2018I\u2019m going to present an\nalgorithm in Knuth\u2019s style,\u2019 and then they completely botch it by ignoring the conventions\nI think are most important. This style must just be a personal style that works for me. So get a personal style that works for you.\u201d In recent papers he has used the pidgin Algol\nstyle introduced by Aho, Hopcroft, and Ullman; but he will not change his style for the\nyet-un\ufb01nished volumes of The Art of Computer Programming because he wants to keep\nthe entire series consistent. Don says that a computer program is a piece of literature. (\u201cI look forward to the day\nwhen a Pulitzer Prize will be given for the best computer program of the year.\u201d)\nHe\nsays that, apart from the bene\ufb01t to be gained for the readers of our programs, he \ufb01nds\nthat treating programs in this manner actually helps to make them run smoothly on the\ncomputer.

        "of course had to tell the printers that this was a deliberate mistake, lest they \u201ccorrect\u201d it). Don outlined three basic algorithms: \ufb01rst \ufb01t (which essentially packs the text as tightly as\npossible one line at a time); best \ufb01t (which can loosen it up if this works better, but still\nworks line by line); and optimum \ufb01t (optimal in the sense that it minimizes the sum of the\n\u201cdemerits\u201d earned by the various distortions of each line, taken over the paragraph as a\nwhole). To describe this last algorithm, Don drew a diagram. It is essentially a graph, each\nnode on level p corresponding to a di\ufb00erent word after which the pth line might be broken. Edges run between nodes on successive levels, and are labeled by the demerits scored by\nthe line of text they de\ufb01ne. The problem of \ufb01nding an optimal \ufb01t thus reduces to \ufb01nding\na least-cost path from the top to the bottom node; well-understood search techniques can\nbe used for this. Don commented that certain \u201cdemerit-cuto\ufb00s\u201d will limit the number of\nnodes on each level and thus speed the algorithm. This means that a solution in which\none very distorted line permits all the rest to be displayed perfectly might be missed. If the above account is opaque, it only goes to show why diagrams can be so useful. The article includes histograms to illustrate how frequently TEX generates more-or-less\ndistorted lines of text.

A second histogram con\ufb01rmed that the text was\nconsiderably more distorted when it hadn\u2019t been hand-crafted to the line width that TEX\nwas generating, yet the new algorithm was signi\ufb01cantly better than Brands X and Y .

When writing for international\naudiences, should we use British or American spellings and conventions?

The Computer Science Department is\no\ufb00ering this class, but until now we have been talking about topics that are generally of\nconcern to all writers who use mathematics. Today we begin to discuss topics speci\ufb01c to\nthe writing of Computer Science. We are not abandoning mathematical concerns; Don says that a technical typist in Com-\nputer Science must know all that a Math department typist must know plus quite a bit\nmore. He showed us two examples where mathematical journals had trouble presenting\nprograms, algorithms, or concrete mathematics in papers he wrote. In order to solve the\n\ufb01rst problem, Don had to convince the typesetters at Acta Arithmetica to create \u201c\ufb02oor\u201d\nand \u201cceiling\u201d functions by carving o\ufb00small pieces of the metal type for square brackets. The second problem had to do with typographic conventions for computer programs; The\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly was using di\ufb00erent fonts for the same symbol at di\ufb00erent\npoints in a procedure, was interchangeably using \u201c:=\u201d, \u201c: =\u201d, and \u201c=:\u201d to represent an\nassignment symbol. Stylistic conventions for programming languages originated with Algol 60. Prior to 1960,",
        "\u00a7\uf736. Excerpts from class, October 12\n[notes by TLL]\nDon opened class by saying that up until now he has been criticizing our writing; now he\nwill show us what he does to his own. Perhaps apropos showing us his own writing he\nquoted Dijkstra: \u201cA good teacher will teach his students the importance of style and how\nto develop their own style\u2014not how to mimic his.\u201d\nFirst he showed us a letter from Bob Floyd. The letter opened by saying \u2018Don, Please stop\nusing so many exclamation points!\u2019 and closed with at least \ufb01ve exclamation points. After\nreceiving this letter he looked in The Art of Computer Programming and found about two\nexclamation points per page. (Among the other biographical tidbits we learned at this\nclass were that Don went to secretarial school, types 80 words per minute, and once knew\ntwo kinds of shorthand.)\nDon is writing a book with Oren Patashnik and Ron Graham. The book is entitled\nConcrete Mathematics and is to be used for CS 260. He showed us two copies of Chapter\nFive of this book: one copy he called \u201cBefore\u201d and one he called \u201cAfter\u201d. The Before copy actually came into existence long after the work on the book began. Oren\nwrote several drafts using the LATEX book style, and then the authors availed themselves\nof the services of a book designer. The designer decided how wide the text was, what\nfonts were to be used, what chapter headings looked like, and a host of other things. The\ndesigner, at the authors\u2019 request, has left room in the inner margins for \u201cgra\ufb03ti.\u201d That\nis, for informal snappy comments from the peanut gallery. (This idea was \u201cstolen\u201d from\nthe booklet Approaching Stanford.)\nThe After copy is just another formally typeset revision of the Before copy. Neither copy\nhas yet been through a professional copy editor. Having now mentioned copy editors and\nbook designers, Don said, \u201cIn these days of author self-publishing, we must not forget the\nvalue of professionals.\u201d (Actually, the copy editor was \ufb01rst mentioned when an error in",

Stylistic conventions for programming languages originated with Algol 60. Prior to 1960,\nFORTRAN and assembly languages were displayed using all uppercase letters in variable-\nwidth fonts that did not mix letters and numbers in a pleasant manner. Fortunately, Algol\u2019s\nvisual presentation was treated with more care: Myrtle Kellington of ACM worked from\nthe beginning with Peter Naur (editor of the Algol report) to produce a set of conventions\nconcerning, among other things, indentation and the treatment of reserved words.

        "And then another minute. There was little to hear but the\nscratching of pencils and the beating of hearts. Don returned. We spent a few minutes looking at the various examples that the class had\ncome up with, some correct and some incorrect. By and large, the class redeemed itself by\nthe creative solutions that were submitted:\nAll the students that know when to use \u2018which\u2019 and \u2018that\u2019 will pass the quiz. The\nexam, which took place at the beginning of class, was not di\ufb03cult. A paper that uses two whiches improperly does not demonstrate that the author\nhasn\u2019t learned anything. My \ufb01rst draft, which was written this summer, had a\nmillion of them. Beware of examples that are misleading. My term paper, which contains many\nwicked whiches, is otherwise not too bad. CS-types just love self-reference, it seems. Is it not true, TLL asked of Mary-Claire, that people invariably get their whiches and\nthats right when they speak? Mary-Claire replied that people almost never say \u2018which\u2019\nimproperly in general speech\u2014it\u2019s only when they feel under pressure that they resort to\nthis unnatural diction. So unnecessary use of \u2018which\u2019 really conveys a bad tone in your\nwriting; it makes you sound nervous. (Conversely, on paper we can often fool our audience\ninto thinking that we are a lot more comfortable than we really are). Don observed that all translations of the Bible are strewn with erroneous whiches. (\u201cThou\nshalt not su\ufb00er a wicked which to live,\u201d he might have said.) A clamour of voices pointed\nout that Fowler is quite clear about the rule. True, but it was never enforced until the late\n70s, Don countered. It seems particularly strange, he said, that the New English Bible\nshould commit this error, as its editors take great pride in the literary qualities of their\ntext. Mary-Claire resolved this mystery: Apparently our \u201coldest and closest allies\u201d on that"

In order to solve the\n\ufb01rst problem, Don had to convince the typesetters at Acta Arithmetica to create \u201c\ufb02oor\u201d\nand \u201cceiling\u201d functions by carving o\ufb00small pieces of the metal type for square brackets. The second problem had to do with typographic conventions for computer programs; The\nAmerican Mathematical Monthly was using di\ufb00erent fonts for the same symbol at di\ufb00erent\npoints in a procedure, was interchangeably using \u201c:=\u201d, \u201c: =\u201d, and \u201c=:\u201d to represent an\nassignment symbol. Stylistic conventions for programming languages originated with Algol 60. Prior to 1960,",
        "\u201d. In fact it was known that H0\nsatis\ufb01es the stated condition, so Don suggested that the authors simplify the statement by\nomitting the j > 0 condition. Moral: Give a simple rule rather than an optimal one. Elsewhere we saw \u201c. . . all the Hj\u2019s . . . \u201d. This is of course the standard way to form\nthe plural of a symbol, but you are going to get into trouble when you start also using\nthe construct H\u2032\nj (that is, Hj primed). A simple way to avoid the problem is just to say:\n\u201c. .",
        ". else char error\npointing to a very brief error-reporting module. We looked at a program written by another student who had the temerity to include some\ncomments critical of WEB. Don struck back with the following:\nIt is good practice to use italics for the names of variables when they appear in\ncomments. Let the variables in the module title correspond to the local parameters in the\nmodule itself. According to this student\u2019s comments, his algorithm uses \u2018tail recursion\u2019. This is\nan impressive phrase, helpful in the proper context; but unfortunately that is not\nthe kind of recursion his program uses. However, Don did grant that his exposition was good, and said that it gave a nice intuition\nabout the functions of the modules. We saw a second program by the same student. It had the usual sprinkling of \u201cwicked\nwhiches\u201d\u2014\u2018which\u2019s that should have been \u2018that\u2019s. The purpose of the program was to\n\u201cenforce\u201d the triangle inequality on a table of data that speci\ufb01ed the distances between\npairs of large cities in the US. Don commented here that his project (from which these\nprograms came) intends to publish interesting data sets so that researchers in di\ufb00erent\nplaces can replicate each other\u2019s results. He also observed that a program running on a\ntable of \u201creal data,\u201d as here (the actual \u201co\ufb03cial\u201d distances between the cities in question)\nis a lot more interesting than the same program running on \u201crandom data.\u201d Returning to\nthe nitty-gritty of the program, Don observed that the student had made a good choice of\nvariable names\u2014for instance \u2018villains\u2019 for those parts of the data that were causing incon-\nsistencies. This \ufb01tted in nicely with the later exposition; he could talk about \u2018cut throats\u2019\nand so forth. (Don added that we nearly always \ufb01nd villainy pretty unamusing in real life,\n[26\n\u00a7\uf731\uf732. LITERATE PROGRAMMING (2)]"

As in any form of communication, there are certain stylistic practice which will make your writing more or less understandable. 
These may be best checked and corrected after writing the first draft. Many of these ideas are from HTWM, and are more fully justified there.

- Notation that hasn't been used in several pages (or even paragraphs) should carry a reference or a reminder of the meaning.
- The structure should be easily discernible by headings and punctuation.
- There should be a clear definition of the problem at hand all the way through.
- The title is the first contact that readers will have with your paper. It must communicate something of the substances to the experts in your field as well as to the novices who will be interested. 
- Don't over work a small punctuation mark such as a period or comma. They are easy for the reader to overlook, and the oversight causes backtracking, confusion, delay. Example: "Assume that a√ÇX. X belongs to the class C, ...". The period between the two X's is overworked.
- A good general rule is: never start a sentence with a symbol. If you insist on starting the sentence with a mention of the thing the symbol denotes, put the appropriate word in apposition, thus: "The set X belongs to the class C, ...".
- The overworked period is no worse than the overworked comma. Not "For invertible X, X* also is invertible", but "For invertible X, the adjoint X* also is invertible."
- I recommend "then" with "if" in all mathematical contexts. The presence of "then" can never confuse; its absence can."
- Another critical feature is the layout or architecture of the page. If it looks like solid prose, it will have a forbidding, sermony aspect; if it looks like computational hash, with a page full of symbols, it will have a frightening, complicated aspect. The golden mean is golden. Break it up, but not too small; use prose, but not too much. Intersperse enough displays to give the eye a chance to help the brain; use symbols, but in the middle of enough prose to keep the mind from drowning in a morass of suffixes." (p. 44-5)
- The same symbol should never be used for more than one thing; if you have used n as a counter in one proof, use m in the next proof, unless the two play a similar role in each
- All notation should be meaningful (no free variables)
- Avoid use of irrelevant symbols. Example: "On a compact space every real-valued continuous function f is bounded." What does the symbol "f" contribute to the clarity of that statement?
- A showy way to say "use no superfluous letters" is to say "use no letter only once"
- In everyday English "any" is an ambiguous word; depending on context that may hint at an existential quantifier ("have you any wool?", "if anyone can do it, he can") or a universal one ("any number can play"). Conclusion: never use "any" in mathematical writing. Replace it by "each" or "every", or recast the whole sentence".
- "Other offenders, charged with lesser crimes, are 'where', and 'equivalent', and 'if... then...if...then'. 
- "Where" is usually a sign of a lazy afterthought that should have been thought through before. "If n is sufficiently large, then |an| < e, where e is a preassigned positive number"; both disease and cure are clear. "Equivalent" for theorems is logical nonsense. (By "theorem" I mean a mathematical truth, something that has been proved. A meaningful statement can be false, but a theorem cannot; "a false theorem" is self-contradictory). 
- As for "if...then...if...then", that is just a frequent stylistic bobble committed by quick writers and rued by slow readers. "If p, then if q, then r." Logically, all is well, but psychologically it is just another pebble to stumble over, unnecessarily. Usually all that is needed to avoid it is to recast the sentence, but no universally good recasting exists; what is best depends on what is important in the case at hand. It could be "If p and q then r", or "In the presence of p, the hypothesis q implies the conclusion r", or many other versions."" 
- Use counter-examples to demonstrate the necessity of conditions on theorem
- Use words correctly: distinguish between function and value
